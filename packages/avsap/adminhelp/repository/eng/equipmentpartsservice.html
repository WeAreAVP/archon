            One of the things that helps to mitigate the obsolescence of your
            playback equipment is access to reliable repair and/or parts. So
            long as a machine can be maintained it can be kept viable and in
            good order for your collections. Establishing a relationship with a
            good repair service for your equipment is a must if you do not have
            the know-how to maintain the equipment yourself. It is best to try
            to find a repair service near enough to you that you don't have to
            ship your equipment to them as shipping can introduce more potential
            for damage.
