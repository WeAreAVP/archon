         <h2>
            Dedicated Inspection Space
         </h2>
         <p class="clear">
            You should have a clean, dust-free, and well-ventilated space
            dedicated to the handling of your audiovisual materials. This space
            can serve as your staging area, where you inspect materials you
            accept into your collections and when you prepare to use them. This
            space is where you can perform basic cleaning and repairs as well.
            Materials to have in this space would include:
         </p>
         <ul class="clear">
            <li>
               appropriate cleansers for the various media types
            </li>
            <li>
               cotton gloves
            </li>
            <li>
               nitrile gloves (these are gloves that are inert and moisture
               proof to protect the hands from cleaning chemicals)
            </li>
            <li>
               safety glasses
            </li>
            <li>
               a loupe
            </li>
            <li>
               lint-free cotton cloths for cleaning This is just a very basic
               list. You will want to include more specific materials based on
               the formats you collect.
            </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
