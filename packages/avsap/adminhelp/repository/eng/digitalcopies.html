            Digital Copies
         </h2>
         <p>
            Digitization is the process by which digital copies of analog
            audiovisual materials are made. Because of the impending
            obsolescence of analog formats, it is clear that digitization will
            become more and more essential. Additionally, making high quality
            digital copies for access purposes spares the originals from
            possible damage. However, a digitization program can be costly for
            an institution. This is one key reason to preserve your analog
            originals for as long as possible. Because digitization also takes
            time and effort, it is best to plan to digitize your materials over
            time, as part of your ongoing preservation workflow.

            Digital formats have evolved quickly in a short period of time and
            continue to evolve. For this reason, we cannot recommend particular
            digital formats. However, there are things to keep in mind when
            choosing to digitize your AV materials:
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>
               First, you will need a playback machine for each format you wish
               to digitize.
            </li>
            <li>
               Second, it is best to use non-proprietary digital formats, where
               possible. Since proprietary formats  are owned by companies, if
               they are no longer supported, you could be  stuck with a great
               number of digital objects and no software to play  them with.
               You could be trading obsolete analog originals for obsolete
               digital surrogates.
            </li>
            <li>
               Third, it is best to digitize your materials using
               <strong>
                  uncompressed
               </strong>
               formats. Compression discards information from a file in order to
               make it  smaller and more manageable. This allows sound and video
               files to be  more accessible and easily shared online. The
               problem with compression,  however, is that as information is
               discarded, it is lost from the  digital copy; it is not possible
               to recover the information. For  example, when a video is
               digitized and compressed, some color  information (along with
               other information) is discarded to maintain a  small file size.
               This color information is then not included in the  compressed
               digital copy and cannot be recovered. For best practices  when
               digitizing an audiovisual original, use uncompressed formats to
               make a
               <strong>
                  digital master
               </strong>
               , which is the highest-quality digital copy possible. You can
               then make smaller, compressed digital &quot;access copies&quot;
               from the digital master.
            </li>
            <li>
               Last but not least, it is important to remember that digital
               copies must also be preserved, which is no easy task. Digital
               objects face obsolescence at least as much as analog objects. As
               digital media  evolve, older formats are sometimes discarded and
               can become difficult to support. For example, were you to have a
               WordStar document today, it would be hard to find a way to access
               that document. AvSAP does not treat digital preservation, since
               it is a vast and burgeoning field. For our purposes here it
               should suffice to say that as you create digital copies of your
               analog originals, you will have to take steps to preserve those
               digital copies. Researching storage systems and digital formats
               will be critical to the long-term  preservation of your digital
               materials.
