            Playback Equipment Maintenance
         </h2>
         <p>
            One of the challenges of audiovisual preservation is the fact that
            most AV formats are not eye-legible. This means that the information
            contained in your AV items cannot be read by the naked eye (with the
            exception of motion picture film). For this reason, it is important
            to maintain playback equipment alongside your AV items, in order to
            make those items accessible. For example, a stack of unique, highly
            valuable (in terms of content) VHS videocassettes does little for
            your institution and your users if you do not have a way to play
            them back. Poorly maintained playback equipment is also potentially
            damaging to your materials, so it is important to make sure that
            your equipment is in good working order.

            Maintaining playback equipment requires specialized technical
            knowledge. It is outside the scope of AvSAP to provide specific
            information about all of the many kinds of audiovisual playback
            equipment. If you are having problems with your playback equipment,
            we strongly encourage you to find a reliable repair service. If you
            are unsure of where to find one, it is a good idea to consult your
            local television/radio stations, university or college film or
            communications departments, or other museums, libraries or archives
            to find out who they use to keep their equipment in good working
            order. If you do not possess the expertise necessary to diagnose and
            maintain your equipment, then creating a good working relationship
            with someone who can is essential to ensuring the accessibility of
            your AV materials.

            It is also an excellent idea to keep records of when your equipment
            was serviced and what was done to it. This can help you to make good
            choices about which pieces of equipment are likely to be safer for
            your materials. If you have not used a piece of equipment in a long
            time, it is best to try it out on a test item that has no value to
            your collections. For example, if you have not used a VCR in a long
            time, or you just procured it, it is best to have a "dummy" VHS tape
            on hand that you can try playing in the machine before you put
            anything valuable in it. Damage to your materials can happen anytime
            you play them back so this test method is not foolproof, but it is a
            good practice to follow
