            Disaster Recovery Plan
         </h2>
         <p>
            A disaster recovery plan establishes how an institution will respond
            to both large and small scale disasters. This plan delineates, among
            other things, how you will treat your materials if they are exposed
            to flooding, smoke, fire, storms, and other disasters. Having a
            disaster plan in place before a disaster strikes can make your
            response much more effective and can potentially keep a bad
            situation from becoming much worse. dPlan is an excellent online
            tool that can guide you through the process of generating a disaster
            recovery plan:

            A good disaster plan can also help you to avert disasters by
            helping you make informed decisions about where to store materials,
            how to prepare for a fire, and so on. A disaster plan should specify
            what the various staff members' responsibilities are in the event of
            a disaster as well as what materials have priority in terms of
            evacuation and recovery (NFPF, 2004, p.67). Using AvSAP to assess
            your materials can help you to generate a prioritized list of what
            materials will need attention in the event of a disaster.
