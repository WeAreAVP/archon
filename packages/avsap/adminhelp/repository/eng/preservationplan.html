            Preservation Plan
         </h2>
         <p>
            A preservation plan is a document that specifies what an
            institution's preservation needs are and what steps the institution
            needs to take to address those needs with the resources it has. To
            be effective, this plan should deal with all of the institution's
            collections. It should also be a living document&mdash;growing over
            time and as collections are added to the institution. AvSAP can help
            your preservation plan be more effective by giving you a deeper
            understanding of what audiovisual collections are most at risk and,
            therefore, which collections require the most pressing preservation
            attention.

            The Northeast Document Conservation Center's (NEDCC) preservation
            planning leaflets are an excellent resource for understanding the
            fundamentals of preservation planning and can be found at
