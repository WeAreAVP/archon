            Allow Loaning to Institutions
         </h2>
         <p>
            Any time media originals leave your institution, they are exposed to
            risk. The rigors of shipping, including temperature and humidity
            variations, can be very hard on your media items. When sharing your
            AV media with other institutions, consider sending access copies
            instead, whenever possible. When materials leave your care, you have
            little to no control over how they are handled. It is best to keep
            your media originals safely in your custody and the access copies
            with the borrowing institution.
