            One of the best ways to troubleshoot or maintain your equipment
            in-house is by consulting the manuals that came with the equipment.
            Most of these manuals are difficult to procure on their own, so it
            is best to keep the manuals in a safe place whenever you acquire
            equipment. Should you need to find manuals for your old equipment,
            one excellent resource is Sam's Technical Publishing, a company that
            sells, among other things, manuals for various kinds of equipment,
            including audiovisual playback devices. Their website is
            <a href="http://www.samswebsite.com/">
               http://www.samswebsite.com/</a>.
            Another possibility for finding equipment manuals is posting a
            request to the listservs for the Association of Moving Image
            Archivists
            (<a href="http://www.amianet.org/">
               http://www.amianet.org/</a>)
            or the Association of Recorded Sound Collections
            (<a href="http://www.arsc-audio.org/">
               http://www.arsc-audio.org/</a>).
