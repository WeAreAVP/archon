            AV Preservation Plan
         </h2>
         <p>
            Preservation plans often give low or no priority to audiovisual
            materials because of their fragility and susceptibility to
            obsolescence. AvSAP can help you assess the AV materials in your
            collections so that you can make informed and targeted decisions in
            terms of what to conserve and reformat, and when. In this way, AvSAP
            can help you revisit your preservation plan to increase the
            prominence of audiovisual materials.
