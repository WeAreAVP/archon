            Allowing Playback
         </h2>
         <p>
            It is a best practice for an institution to create duplicates of its
            media originals for access. Some institutions, however, will not
            have the time or the resources to duplicate their originals. In
            these cases, it is best to protect the originals from wear as much
            as possible. To this end, we recommend that you not allow your users
            to play back the originals without assistance from your staff.
            Playback machines can put stress on all audiovisual materials, even
            those that are in excellent shape. Your staff have more experience
            with your audiovisual materials and playback equipment and should
            handle and monitor playback for your users whenever possible.
