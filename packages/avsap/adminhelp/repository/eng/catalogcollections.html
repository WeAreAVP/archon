            If you do not know what is held in your collection, the items may be
            especially vulnerable to theft, neglect, deterioration, improper
            storage and deaccessioning. Most institutions have some sort of
            inventory control or finding aid for items. These may be created for
            internal inventory control purposes when an item is accessioned into
            the collection. However, these accession records may not be
            authoritative, descriptive, or publicly searchable.
         </p>
         <p>
            Machine-readable media such as videotape, audiotape, and digital
            files are especially vulnerable if no descriptive or cataloging data
            are available. These items cannot be visually browsed or skimmed
            like books, and rely on machines for information retrieval.
         </p>
         <p>
            In order to make these analog or digital items searchable, it is
            important to collect information about the object. Information such
            as a unique identifier, title, creator, date, format, collection
            size, access restrictions, and use restrictions (based on
            intellectual property and copyright issues) are key elements for
            access. At the very minimum, you should consider documenting this
            information.
