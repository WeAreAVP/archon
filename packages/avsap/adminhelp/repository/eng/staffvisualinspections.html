            Visual Inspections
         </h2>
         <p>
            Visual diagnostic inspections of audiovisual media can identify
            problems such as pest exposure, mold, and physical damage, and can
            be very effective in assessing the condition of AV items. Visual
            inspections are also safer than playback inspections; playback
            inspections always put an AV item at risk for damage, even if the
            item and playback deck are in good condition. Unfortunately, the
            intricacies of audiovisual formats often make it so that even if an
            AV item has been visually inspected and found to be in good order,
            it could still have poor image and/or sound in playback. Thus, a
            playback inspection can often be more diagnostic than a simple
            visual inspection. However, while AvSAP recognizes this, because of
            the potential for damage, we do not recommend playback inspections.
