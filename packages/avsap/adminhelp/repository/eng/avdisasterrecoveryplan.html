            Audiovisual materials are susceptible to damage when disaster
            strikes. When crafting a disaster plan, make sure to include your
            audiovisual collections. Some basic tips to consider: first, do not
            store your irreplaceable original materials in a basement. Basements
            take on water during floods and storms; you want to make sure your
            materials are in a humidity and temperature-controlled
            environment&mdash;above the basement. Second, when storing materials
            on shelving, it is best to keep the materials off of the bottom two
            or three shelves. This will help to minimize their exposure to flood
            waters. It is also a good idea to store materials as far from water
            pipes (particularly those in your ceiling) as possible to help
            prevent damage in the event of a water leak. Having fire
            extinguishers available nearby is also a good policy.
