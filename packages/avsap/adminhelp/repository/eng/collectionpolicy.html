            Collection Policy
         </h2>
         <p>
            A collection development policy or mission statement can help an
            institution determine the kinds of materials it collects, both in
            terms of content and object type. It can help prevent the
            institution from collecting materials that would be better suited
            elsewhere. For example, if you work for the Abraham Lincoln
            Presidential Library and have a 16mm film about the canyons of
            southern Utah, you would most likely find that the film does not
            serve your institution's mission. Additionally, finding a more
            appropriate home for the film would mean one less audiovisual object
            for you to store and preserve, which would free up funds and space.
            Adhering to your mission statement can also help
            researchers&mdash;after all, how many are likely to come to the
            Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library looking for a film about Utah's
            canyons?
