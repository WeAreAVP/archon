         <p>
            If you're unsure if your institution owns the rights to a particular
            work then you should assume you do not. Presently, the only
            materials known safe from copyright protection are those in the
            public domain and those where explicit permission has been granted
            by the rights holder. As stated in the Film Preservation Guide,
            &quot;Copyright and donor agreements define how institutions
            preserve their motion picture materials and share them with the
            public&quot; (NFPF, 2004, p. 77). If you don't own the rights to an
            item and are unsure who does, you may be able to locate the owner
            through the U.S. Copyright office by searching through the Copyright
            records:
            <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/records/" target="_blank">http://www.copyright.gov/records/</a>

            Section 108 of the Copyright code currently provides archives and
            libraries with very specific and limited rights to duplicate
            materials for very specific preservation or access needs. However,
            Section 108 does not allow for unlimited duplication. For example,
            in the case of unpublished works, the library or archives must
            already have a copy of the work before preservation copies can be
            made. For published works, libraries and archives can only make
            duplicates to replace a copy it has or used to have in its
            collection, because the copy has been damaged, is deteriorating,
            lost or stolen, or the format has become obsolete(Harper, 2007).
            Additionally, copying can only occur after effort has been made to
            locate the item in a current, non-obsolete format at a reasonable
            price.
         </p>
         <p>
            We strongly recommend you research section 108 prior to making
            duplication decisions so you are aware of your rights. Copyright
            laws are in flux, so it is advisable to revisit the current status
            of the law to ensure that provisions have not changed. The Copyright
            Crash Course sponsored by University of Texas' Libraries is a good
            resource for copyright basics as they apply to libraries and
            archives:
            <a href="http://copyright.lib.utexas.edu/" target="_blank">http://copyright.lib.utexas.edu/</a>
         </p>
         <p>
            If you do not have the rights to perform preservation measures on an
            item and if you do not think you can procure those rights, then this
            item will score slightly lower in your decision list.

            Copyright and intellectual property issues are thorny, especially
            when considering archival materials and copying. In general,
            copyright grants rights holders five exclusive right to their works:
         </p>
         <ol class="decimal">
            <li>
               Reproduction (the right to make a copy of the work)
            </li>
            <li>
               Distribution (the right to disseminate physical copies to others)
            </li>
            <li>
               Public performance (the right to publicly screen, broadcast, or
               show film through various venues including on the Internet)
            </li>
            <li>
               The right to prepare derivative works (for film, this generally
               means remakes or adaptations)
            </li>
            <li>
               The right of public display (public display embraces the use of
               frame enlargements and the presentation of video in a museum
               exhibit)&quot; (NFPF, 2004, p. 77)
            </li>
         </ol>
         <p>
            If your institution has secured a transfer of rights from a donor
            for a specific work, you still may not have the full right make the
            work accessible through digital systems or public presentation. In
            the case of film, there may be many underlying rights such rights
            associated with the music in the film or to the literary work on
            which the film is based In the case of audio works, some rights may
            be covered under federal law and also by state law. You may be able
            to provide access through the doctrine of Fair Use; however, this is
            not a fail-safe way to circumvent copyright. Before copying and
            making materials accessible (especially if your intent is to provide
            access via the Internet), be sure to research what copyrights your
            materials are covered under, who owns the rights, and understand the
            provisions and risks associated with Fair Use. Fair Use:

         </p>
         <p>
            As with the previous question, if you do not have the rights to make
            this item accessible to the public and if you do not think you can
            procure those rights, then this item will score slightly lower in
            your decision list.
