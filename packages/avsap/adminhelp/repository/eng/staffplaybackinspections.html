            Playback Inspections
         </h2>
         <p>
            Audiovisual materials pose a dilemma to preservation professionals:
            in order to know for sure the condition of many kinds of AV
            materials, we must play them. However, playback poses risks to
            materials that we cannot always anticipate. Even a videotape in
            pristine condition can be damaged by a playback machine. To further
            complicate the issue, it is often difficult to predict with visual
            inspection alone&mdash;particularly with magnetic video and audio
            tapes&mdash;which items will have trouble in playback. When using
            AvSAP, remember that playback assessments for formats like magnetic
            audio and video tape, which cannot be reliably visually assessed,
            are more diagnostic but are also more potentially perilous. For this
            reason, we do not recommend playback assessments unless you are
            reasonably sure of the physical integrity of your AV items and the
            proper functioning and cleanliness of your playback devices.
