            One of the hallmarks of audiovisual preservation is that we strive
            to preserve originals of the media object. Here, "original" refers
            to the earliest generation of an audiovisual object. In some cases,
            it will come right out of the capturing device&mdash;for example,
            film or videotape from a camera. In many instances, however, an
            institution will not know if it is holding the "original." For
            example, you may have a 16mm film and have no idea if it is the
            earliest version. In this case, you must assume that it is the
            original and treat it as such.

            Successive iterations of an audiovisual object tend to have
            degrading picture and sound quality&mdash;which is all the more
            reason to actively preserve the originals. Ideally, the originals
            should be used once to make an "access copy." The access copy would
            then be put to use by the institution in place of the original. For
            example, if your institution has a 16mm film, the best policy would
            be to transfer the film and allow the duplicate to be the viewing
            copy for the public. This would save the original film from the wear
            and tear of use.
