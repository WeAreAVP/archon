            Cleaning Media
         </h2>
         <p>
            Audiovisual preservation requires a great deal of specialized
            knowledge. Knowing how to clean and repair your media, to the extent
            that it can be done in-house, is an excellent way to maximize your
            preservation budget. Some formats, like grooved disc audio media and
            motion picture film, are very amenable to in-house cleaning. Other
            formats, like most magnetic video and audio media, are not as easily
            repaired in-house. Getting this specialized knowledge has
            traditionally been difficult, but in recent years the internet has
            become an excellent resource. One example is the "Video Aids to Film
            Preservation" website, which contains a great deal of images, text,
            and video showing the user how to use film preservation equipment,
            do basic repairs, and clean motion picture film. The website can be
            found at:
            <a href="http://www.folkstreams.net/vafp/">http://www.folkstreams.net/vafp/</a>.
            Another excellent resource is the Texas Commission on the Arts'
            "Videotape Identification and Assessment Guide" at
            <a href="http://www.arts.state.tx.us/video/">http://www.arts.state.tx.us/video/</a>.
            This website, which provided a great deal of images to AvSAP, is
            dedicated to identifying and assessing the variety of videotape
            formats that are available. The National Film Preservation
            Foundation has published another good motion picture film
            preservation resource, the "Film Preservation Guide," which is
            available as a free download:
            <a href="http://www.filmpreservation.org">http://www.filmpreservation.org</a>.

            However, nothing can compare with the experience you can gain from
            taking a hands-on audiovisual preservation workshop. Many are
            available throughout the year through local and national
            professional organizations like the Association of Moving Image
            Archivists (AMIA)
            <a href="http://www.amianet.org/">http://www.amianet.org/</a>,
            the Association of Recorded Sound Collections (ARSC)
            <a href="http://www.arsc-audio.org/">http://www.arsc-audio.org/</a>,
            the Society of American Archivists (SAA)
            <a href="http://www.archivists.org/">http://www.archivists.org/</a>,
            the American Library Association (ALA)
            <a href="http://www.ala.org/">http://www.ala.org/</a>,
            and many more. Consulting the websites and joining the email
            listservs for these organizations are excellent ways to stay
            up-to-date on the audiovisual workshops and lectures in your area.

            It is also very important to make sure you have appropriate cleaning
            and repair equipment for your AV media, if you want to do this
            in-house. As you use AvSAP to assess your materials, we will give
            you guidance with regard to doing hands-on cleaning and repair work.
