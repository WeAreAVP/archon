            Wire - Physical Damage
         </h2>
         <p>
            One of the most common issues that arises when handling wire
            recordings is tangled wire. The wire is extremely thin (approx .004
            inches thick) and can wrap around itself and become tangled and
            possibly break. This problem is an annoyance but can be relatively
            easily resolved&mdash;the wire just needs to be untangled and
            rewound onto the reel. Breaks in the wire can be repaired by
            knotting the two ends of the wire together. Since wire travels at a
            high transport speed, the knot will be a minor sonic disturbance
            during playback. However, wire in poor shape (many breaks, crimps
            and tangles) may be indicative of prior neglect. Retrieving recorded
            signal from wire in poor shape may prove more difficult than in
            other cases.
