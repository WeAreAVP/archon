            Wire - Storage Container
         </h2>
         <p>
            Although most wire recordings were composed of stainless steel 
            recording-grade wire, some early wire recordings were composed of
            less rust-resistant material. Removing the wire recordings from
            their original cardboard containers&mdash;which are subject to mold
            infestation and do not protect the recordings from
            moisture&mdash;and storing the recordings in a protective plastic
            container is recommended.
