            Wire - Orientation in Storage
         </h2>
         <p>
            There does not seem to be a professional preference for storing wire
            recordings in either a horizontal or vertical position. We recommend
            securing the wire around the reel so that it does not become loose
            and tangle; you can use either unrecorded stainless steel wire or
            plastic as leader. Some professionals recommend storing wires in the
            &quot;tails out&quot; (end of the recording at the top of the reel
            rather than close to the hub of the reel) to lessen the effects of
            print through. However, this may not be practical due to the
            scarcity of wire recording equipment and the risk involved in
            mounting the wire on the playback equipment.
