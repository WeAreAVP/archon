            Wire - Rust
         </h2>
         <p>
            Although wire recordings are generally composed of recording-grade
            stainless steel, some recordings prior to WWII were made on steel
            wire, which is prone to rust. Rust can weaken the already thin wire
            and cause it to break during handling or playback. It can even
            impede signal retrieval. However, occurrences of rust on wire are
            typically rare.
