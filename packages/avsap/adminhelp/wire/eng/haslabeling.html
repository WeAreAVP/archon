            Wire - Labeling
         </h2>
         <p>
            Correct labeling on a container can offer important clues about what
            is recorded on the wire. If you are replacing a container that has
            labeling information, it is important to transfer this information
            to the new container or label. Original container labels should be
            regarded with caution, however, as containers are frequently reused
            or switched by accident. If possible, verify the validity of the
            container label. Your recording may have a matrix number imprinted
            on it, which can be used to reference a catalog entry that can
            verify the content on the recording. As wire recordings are often
            not commercially produced, however, you may have to go on good faith
            that the container label properly identifies the intellectual
            content of the wire&mdash;since there probably will not be
            additional resources to consult.
