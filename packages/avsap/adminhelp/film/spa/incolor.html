            This question may involve unspooling the film to answer. We
            recommend doing this only after you've looked at our
            &quot;Film Handling Basics&quot; section. Unspooling film is not
            without risk. If you are unable or unwilling to unspool your film
            and you have no supporting information which may answer this
            question, we recommend you click on &quot;I Don't Know.&quot;

               Black and white negative film often has a greyish or purplish
               cast

               Color negative film often has an orange cast

               The easiest way to determine if a film is in color is to unspool
               it and look at a few frames.

               If you have a film that has some parts in color and some in black
               and white be sure to click on &quot;color/both&quot;

            Black and white motion picture film contains silver salt particles
            which are suspended in a gelatin binder. During processing, these
            salts are converted to metallic silver particles, which is what the
            image on the film is composed of.
