            This question may involve unspooling the film to answer. We
            recommend doing this only after you've looked at our &quot;Film
            Handling Basics&quot; section. Unspooling film is not without risk.
            If you are unable or unwilling to unspool your film and you have no
            supporting information which may answer this question, we recommend
            you click on &quot;I Don't Know.&quot;

            Shrinkage is when the film has &quot;contracted from its original
            dimensions&quot; (FPG, p. 107). That is, the film, through chemical
            process, decay, and/or overly dry conditions, has become smaller.
            This can be an issue as the sprocket holes may not align correctly
            with the sprockets within the projector. If misalignment occurs, the
            film can be damaged. Most significant shrinkage in acetate film is
            due to vinegar syndrome, which also causes the film base to become
            brittle.

            You can measure shrinkage by using a shrinkage gauge, which is a
            piece of equipment which measures the difference between standard
            sprocket holes and the film being measured.

            A low-cost approach to determining if a film has shrinkage is to
            compare it to 100 frames of new leader. If the film is shorter than
            the 100 frames, it has shrunken. If the shrinkage is very obvious
            and dramatic (anything over half a frame difference) do not project
            the film!

            Shrunken film can be duplicated by an experienced lab. If you have
            shrunken film but do not currently have the funds available to copy
            it, you can freeze the film to slow or halt the decay until a later
            time when the film can be duplicated.
