<h2>Magnetic (Mag) Stock Breakdown</h2>
<p>
Mag, or magnetic, stock holds sound information. It can be an entire reel on its own or can be a soundtrack stripe along the edge of the film. It is identified by its dull, brown magnetic recording layer. Mag stock has the same properties of magnetic audio tape and is subject to the same kind of decay - decay often related to being stored in humid conditions. It can become sticky and adhere to the film as the film is unwound from the reel. Acetate films with magnetic soundtracks are especially prone to vinegar syndrome. You can assess the breakdown by looking at the mag stripe. Is it flaking? Is it sticking to the round of the film reel? Does the film smell like vinegar?
