            Labeling
         </h2>
         <p class="strong">
            If your item has any kind of labeling on the container, the item
            itself, or any related material we highly recommend that you return
            to the General tab under Assessments Manager, and enter this
            information in the notes field.
         </p>
         <p>
            Labeling on a container or leader, if it is correct, can offer
            important clues about what is on the film. If you are replacing a
            container or leader which holds labeling information, it is
            important to transfer this information to the new container or
            label. As advised by the Film Preservation Guide, be sure to copy
            down any titles, dates or production data found on these items and
            save notes housed in the can. The guide also warns that container
            labels should be used with caution as cans frequently are reused or
            switched by accident.
