            This question may involve unspooling the film to answer. We
            recommend doing this only after you've looked at our &quot;Film
            Handling Basics&quot; section. Unspooling film is not without risk.
            If you are unable or unwilling to unspool your film and you have no
            supporting information which may answer this question, we recommend
            you click on &quot;I Don't Know.&quot;

            A sound track on film is often identified by a continuous stripe
            running along the length of the film. It looks considerably
            different than the film picture frames. The strip may be a
            reddish-brown color (a magnetic, or mag, sound track). It may look
            like two strips which contain similar wavy forms (a variable area
            optical sound track) or it may look like a gray strip of varying
            darkness (a variable density optical sound track).

            The sound track may not be on the film but may be a separate,
            individual element. For example, some film makers create a full-coat
            mag, which is &quot;a production or preservation element (a part of
            a entire production) in which the magnetic oxide recording layer
            covers one full side of the film surface&quot; (FPG, p. 102). If
            your film does not have a sound track and it is a 35mm or 16mm, you
            may want to seek out production notes to determine if there are any
            additional sound elements. As advised in the Film Preservation
            Guide, preservationists should watch for commentary, dialog or music
            recorded on a separate audiotape reel or cassette intended to be
            played with the film during screening, with amateur and avant-garde
            films in particular.
