         <p class="strong">
            It's easy to tell if a film has leader. Look at the outer layers of
            the film. Leader is usually white, yellow or clear and often has
            writing on it (but not always). The writing could be the name of the
            film, the filmmaker, etc. A film without leader is at greater risk
            for damage and dust contamination. A film without leader will have a
            higher preservation priority.

            Leader can be made of white or clean polyester film stock or
            unprocessed black-and-white print stock which is attached to the
            beginning or end of a film, or in some cases, spliced between
            shorter films to separate individual films on a single reel.
            Some preservationists prefer using different color leader for the
            head and the tail (beginning and end) of the film. Leader is used
            to protect the film and can also be a place where pertinent
            information about a film can be written. As projected film is most
            likely to be damaged at the beginning and end of the film,
            leader should be fairly long (enough leader to wrap around the reel
            a few times) so that there is sufficient leader to protect the film
            at the head and the tail. If there are any issues with the projector
            feed, ideally the leader would take the brunt of the damage. Damaged
            leader is easier to replace than unique film frames. Dirty or
            damaged leaders should be removed and replaced. If replacing leader
            which contains information transcribe that information onto the new
            leader.
