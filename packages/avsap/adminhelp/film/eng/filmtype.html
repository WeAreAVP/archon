            This question may involve unspooling the film to answer. We
            recommend doing this only after you've looked at our &quot;Film
            Handling Basics&quot; section. Unspooling film is not without risk.
            If you are unable or unwilling to unspool your film and you have no
            supporting information which may answer this question, we recommend
            you click on &quot;I Don't Know.&quot;

         <p class="strong clear">Film Type At-A-Glance:</p>
         <ul class="strong clear">
            <li>
               Reversal and negative films are the highest preservation priority
               because they are usually irreplaceable
            </li>
            <li>
               Negative film often has a purplish, greyish or orangish cast
            </li>
            <li>
               In negative films the light parts and dark parts of the image are
               reversed (for example, the sky will appear dark)
            </li>
            <li>
               Print films are the lowest in terms of preservation priority
            </li>
            <li>
               In print film, the images will look intuitively
               appropriate&mdash;light parts and dark parts are appropriate to
               reality (for example, the sky is light)
            </li>
            <li>
               Magnetic stock is at a moderate preservation priority
            </li>
            <li>
               Magnetic stock has a magnetic information layer that looks like
               audiotape and has an dark brown to orange cast
            </li>
            <li>
               Magnetic stock, if it is older, often has an orangish powder on
               it (see below for images)
            </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
            For the purposes of this AvSAP assessment, film may be one of four
            elements: print, reversal, negative, or mag stock. These terms refer
            to how the film has been created and processed.

         <h3>Print (Positive)</h3>

         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>
               positive image
            </li>
            <li>
               print is produced from a film negative, and projected for viewing
            </li>
            <li>
               film edge is clear
            </li>
         </ul>
         <h3>Negative</h3>
         <p class="citation">
            <img src="packages/avsap/adminhelp/film/images/bw16mmNegsm.jpg"
                 alt="b&amp;w film negative" />
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>
               negative image; images are reversed from a positive print
            </li>
            <li>
               bright places on a print are dark on a negative
            </li>
         </ul>
         <h3>Reversal</h3>
         <p class="citation">
            <img src="packages/avsap/adminhelp/film/images/filmReversalsm.jpg"
                 alt="film reversal " />
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>
               positive image
            </li>
            <li>
               no film negative is produced; the film that is run through the
               camera to capture the image is the same film that is projected
               for viewing
            </li>
            <li>
               film edge is often black
            </li>
         </ul>
         <h3>Mag Stock</h3>
         <p class="citation">
            <img src="packages/avsap/adminhelp/film/images/fullCoat.jpg"
                 alt="fullcoat mag" />
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>
               no image; holds only sound information
            </li>
            <li>
               dull, brown magnetic coated film
            </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
            Prints, or positives, are created from a negative and are projected
            for viewing. The film holds a positive image (one that appears
            natural to the eye).
         </p>
         <p>
            A negative is a film that has light-sensitive emulsion which is
            exposed in the camera. The emulsion on a film negative is softer
            than that of a film print, so negatives should be handled with the
            utmost care, if they must be handled at all. Negatives should be
            considered a higher preservation risk since they usually represent
            the original generation of a film and often cannot be replaced. Film
            negatives are fairly easy to identify since the images on them are
            reversed from a positive print&mdash; bright places on a print are
            dark on a negative and vice versa. Film negatives look like still
            photographic negatives. For example, the sky in a negative will
            appear dark whereas in a positive print or a piece of reversal film
            the sky will appear very light. The negative is an important element
            because it is used to make projection prints.

            Reversal film is similar to photographic slide film in that reversal
            film is run through the camera to capture the motion picture
            subject. After processing, the same film is projected back for
            viewing&mdash;there is no film negative. You can identify a
            projected print and a reversal film by looking at the edge of the
            film. If the edge near the film is clear, it is a print produced
            from a negative. If the edge is black, it is most likely a reversal
            film.

            Mag, or magnetic, stock holds sound information. It can be an entire
            reel on its own or a soundtrack stripe along the edge of the film.
            It is identified by its dull, brown magnetic recording layer. Mag
            stock has some of the same properties of magnetic audio tape and is
            subject to the same kind of decay&mdash;decay often related to being
            stored in humid conditions. It can become sticky and adhere to the
            film as the film is unwound from the reel.
