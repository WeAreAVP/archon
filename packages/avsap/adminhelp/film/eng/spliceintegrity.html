            This question may involve unspooling the film to answer. We
            recommend doing this only after you've looked at our &quot;Film
            Handling Basics&quot; section. Unspooling film is not without risk.
            If you are unable or unwilling to unspool your film and you have no
            supporting information which may answer this question, we recommend
            you click on &quot;I Don't Know.&quot;

            A splice is where two pieces of film are joined. Usually, splices 
            are made during film editing, although they can be made to repair a
            film, join two different film reels, or to attach leader to a film.
            You can identify splices by observing tape on the film surface (in
            the case of tape splices) or in a slight overlap of film (in the
            case of cement splices).

            You can check the quality of the splice by gently rotating the
            splice in opposite directions to see if the splice holds (Bigourdan,
            n.d). If the splice is weak, dirty or has tape residue, the film
            around the splice should be cleaned and the splice should be removed
            and replaced. As directed by the Film Preservation Guide, old
            splicing material can be loosened by gently applying film cleaner
            with a lint-free cloth or cotton swab. &quot;A razor blade or other
            sharp tool can be helpful in removing tape. It is essential to
            remove all visible residue before continuing&quot; (FPG, 2004).

            To repair splices, you'll need a splicer and splicing tape or cement
            depending upon the kind of splicer you have. Cement results in a
            more permanent splice, but cannot be used on polyester film. If you
            are splicing film with a soundtrack, be mindful that you will lose
            that portion of sound where you are making the splice. Additionally,
            the soundtrack does not align with the corresponding image, but
            precedes the image in projection.
