            This question may involve unspooling the film to answer. We
            recommend doing this only after you've looked at our "Film Handling
            Basics" section. Unspooling film is not without risk. If you are
            unable or unwilling to unspool your film and you have no supporting
            information which may answer this question, we recommend you click
            on "I Don't Know."

            Motion picture film can be very long-lived when stored properly.
            That said, it can also be a very fragile medium.Â Film that is
            damaged even slightly can be damaged even more during playback.
            AvSAP considers damaged film to be at higher risk.

            Film damage can include scratches, torn sprocket holes, and torn
            film. It is absolutely critical to inspect film before playing it
            back. Projectors put film under great amounts of torque and that
            force can cause small tears to be full breaks. Film that has even
            minor tears (particularly to the sprocket holes) can be irreparably
            shredded during projection.

            Ideally a user should unspool a film on rewinds before projecting or
            sending off for transfer to video (telecine). Carefully inspect the
            sprocket holes as you wind through the film. Take a look at splices
            and make sure they are still intact. Make sure that the film is all
            in one piece&mdash;many times small pieces of film will be wound in
            a reel and will need to either be spliced into the larger film or
            removed and wound onto their own cores.
         </p>
         <p>
            When you unspool your film be sure to note what kinds of damage the
            film is suffering from and, ideally, where on the film (in terms of
            feet) the damage occurs. This information should be recorded in the
            finding aid or catalog entry for this film. If you are sending this
            film out for repair and/or transfer work, be sure to pass this
            information on to them.
