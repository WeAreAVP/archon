            Cores

         <p class="strong">
            Ideally films should be stored on cores (not on reels&mdash;see
            below for a discussion of the differences between reels and cores).
            Films stored on reels or stored not on a reel but without cores are
            considered higher preservation priorities.
         </p>
         <p>
            A core is distict from a reel. A reel is a &quot;metal or plastic
            hub with extended sides between which the film is wound for
            projection&quot; (NFPF, p. 106). Reels&mdash;especially metal,
            dented or otherwise damaged reels&mdash;are
            <strong>
               NOT
            </strong>
            appropriate for long-term storage.

            Film on a reel compared to film on a three inch, inert plastic core
         </p>
         <p>
            These cores should be made of an inert plastic material. For 16mm
            and 35mm it is recommended by the National Film Preservation
            Foundation (NFPF) that the core is at least three inches wide. A
            larger core diameter lessens the stress on the film as the film does
            not have to wind as tightly around a larger core as it would with a
            small core. Smaller gauge film may be wound on smaller (less than
            3&quot;) cores.
