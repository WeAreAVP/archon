            Film - Appropriate Container
         </h2>
         <p class="strong clear">
            Optimal appropriate film containers:
         </p>
         <ul class="strong clear">
            <li>
               protect the film from damage, dust, and other contaminants
            </li>
            <li>
               do not exacerbate film deterioration&mdash;dirty, rusty, non-vented,
               dented, metal containers can heighten the potential for film
               surface damage
            </li>
            <li>
               particularly in the case of acetate films, a good canister allows
               a film to &quot;breathe&quot;; that is, the canister is vented to
               allow for air exchange
            </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
            Ideally, motion picture film should be stored in vented plastic
            cans.  Film stored in metal containers or stored without a container
            will have a higher preservation priority.

            inert plastic container with desiccants (the white sachets on either
            side of the film).

            Film without a container is especially vulnerable to damage or
            contamination&mdash;surface scratching, unwinding, dust and mold.
            According to the NFPF Film Preservation Guide, &quot;Film
            containers&mdash;boxes or cans&mdash;should be convenient to use and
            should protect the film from dust and physical damage&quot;
            (NFPF, p. 66).
         </p>

            If your film is stored in a rusty, dirty container it is not
            receiving adequate protection. Dirt and rust flakes can scratch the
            delicate film surface. You should consider replacing damaged
            containers in order to increase the longevity of your film.
         </p>
         <p>
            Containers are made from a variety of materials; inert plastics,
            non-corrosive metal and cardboard. The container your institution
            uses will largely depend upon the film storage environment. Are you
            storing your film in a standard room-temperature environment? Are
            they stored in a freezer? If you are storing your film in a
            room-temperature environment, polypropylene or polyethylene
            containers which are vented are optimal. This will allow for the
            film to &quot;breathe&quot; and to off-gas vapors that may be
            emitted from the film. If you are storing your film in freezing
            temperatures, your cans should be sealed and moisture-resistant.
            In either case, cans should be clean and free from debris, rust and
            structural damage (NFPF, 2004).
         </p>
         <p>
            When freezing film ensure that the the film is properly housed by
            double-bagging it in zip-sealed freezer bags. If you are interested
            in freezing infrequently accessed materials refer to The Home Film
            Preservation Guide, sec. 8

            for detailed steps on how prepare your film for long-term
            freezing (NFPF, 2004).
