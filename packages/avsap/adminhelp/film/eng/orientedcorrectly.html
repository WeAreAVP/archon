            Correct Orientation in Storage
         </h2>
         <p>
            Film should be stored stacked like you see below. Film stored over
            time in different orientations increases its preservation priority.
         </p>
         <p>
            Film is heavy! Because of its weight and the way that it is wound,
            it is best to store film flat and on an inert plastic core. Doing so
            will allow the film to keep an even, rounded shape. Stacking film on
            reels without a film canister of some kind is not recommended
            because the reels will, over time, be compressed and can press into
            the film itself.
