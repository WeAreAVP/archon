            Nitrate
         </h3>
         <p>
            Nitrate in the beginning stages of decay will have a noxious odor,
            like &quot;dirty socks.&quot; Be careful when testing film for
            odor&mdash;open the film can away from your nose and face so you are
            not exposed to irritating or toxic fumes and particles. You should
            be able to detect an odor without having your nose in close contact
            with the film.

               Deterioration Starting.
            </strong>
            As a guide to assigning a value, nitrate in this condition would
            have no decay or be in the earliest stages of decay. Due to the
            age and inherent vice of nitrate film, it will most likely have some
            decay. If the film is still flexible, with little to no damage to
            the emulsion or image, it should be considered.
            <strong>
               If you have nitrate film, AvSAP recommends that you not use a
               score of &quot;0,&quot; however good the condition of the film
               appears to be.

               Actively Deteriorating.
            </strong>
            Nitrate in this condition will exhibit emulsion damage and will most
            likely include image-area damage. It will have a noticeable noxious
            odor and may stick to itself as it is unwound. Nitrate film requires
            special care in handling, and a film with a
            <em>
               2
            </em>
            rating will imply some damage. As such, this film will need to be
            sent to a vendor for content retrieval and transfer.
         </p>
         <p>
            If you discover you have degrading nitrate film, store it in a cold
            to freezing environment as soon as possible to avoid further damage
            to the film and surrounding materials and to prevent fire. If you do
            not have the resources to properly and safely handle nitrate film,
            contact an institution who may, and strongly consider transferring
            the film to  that institution. DO NOT throw away nitrate film!
            Firstly, it could be  a valuable and unique resource. Secondly,
            nitrate is considered a hazardous material and must be disposed of
            properly.

               Critical Deterioration.
            </strong>
            Nitrate film in this condition is extremely dangerous and volatile.
            The content of the film is most likely irretrievable as the film has
            congealed into a solid mass or has disintegrated into a brownish
            powder.
            <strong>
               DO NOT DISPOSE OF THE FILM BY THROWING IT IN THE GARBAGE!
            </strong>
            Nitrate is considered a hazardous material and must be disposed of
            properly. You will want to contact a local HAZMAT disposal center to
            safely remove and dispose of these materials. Contact your regional
            waste disposal office if you need guidance.

            Acetate
         </h3>
         <p>
            One of the key signs that an acetate film is degrading is the
            presence of a vinegar smell. This degradation results from the
            chemical breakdown of the acetate into acetic acid, and is known
            as &quot;vinegar syndrome.&quot; When the film can is opened, the
            odor can be very strong and unmistakable.
         </p>
         <p>
            Although the vinegar odor is often the most obvious sign that an
            acetate film is degrading, it is not the only sign. Acetate film
            that  is degrading becomes brittle. The film loses its suppleness
            and does  not gently curve around the core or reel; instead, the
            film appears  jagged or &quot;spoked.&quot; The film base will also
            shrink. Projecting a film  which has shrunk will further damage the
            film because the sprocket  holes of the film will no longer properly
            align with the sprockets on the projector. You can also test the
            level of acetate decay by using  A-D Strips. These strips, developed
            by the Image Permanence Institute, change color based upon the level
            of acidic vapor detected. A-D Strips can give you a finer level of
            assessment beyond visual and olfactory cues. To help prevent or
            slow acetate decay, you can also place  molecular sieves in your
            film cans. These desiccants will help absorb acetic acid and
            moisture in a sealed film can.
         </p>
         <p>
            AvSAP has adapted the Image Permanence Institute's A-D Strip scoring
            method to rate vinegar syndrome in acetate film. A-D strips are an
            excellent way to score and monitor vinegar syndrome. Using A-D
            Strips in conjunction with AvSAP can make your vinegar syndrome
            assessment  much more accurate. For more information about A-D
            Strips, click here:

            The following is an AvSAP guide to rating acetate decay (vinegar
            syndrome):

         <p>
            <strong>
               No Deterioration.
            </strong>
            This film is suffering from no acetate decay.
         </p>
         <p>
            <strong>
               Deterioration Starting.
            </strong>
            Acetate decay is starting. This film should be moved to cold storage
            if possible and monitored. The film is  flexible, with little (less
            than 1%) to no apparent shrinkage. There  may be a very faint
            vinegar smell.
         </p>
         <p>
            <strong>
               Actively Deteriorating.
            </strong>
            This film is actively deteriorating. It should be moved to cold
            storage if possible and  duplicated. The film will have a stronger
            vinegar odor and may exhibit  shrinkage (between .8 to 2%). The film
            may be able to be accessed and  played back in-house by an
            experienced technician using maintained and  functioning equipment.
            The film will also exhibit some waviness along  the edges; it may
            curl slightly and resist lying flat (NFPF, 2004).

               Critical Deterioration.
            </strong>
            This film is exhibiting shrinkage and warping. It may be difficult
            or impossible to handle the film without  damaging it. The film
            should be frozen if possible. The vinegar odor is  unmistakable.
            (You should exercise caution when opening all film cans and avoid
            sticking your nose into the can&mdash; you could be in for a very
            unpleasant and potentially dangerous surprise!) The emulsion layer
            looks cracked and may already have separated from the film base. The
            film is very brittle and inflexible. It may appear to be
            &quot;spoking&quot; in  the film can: the film pack does not look
            rounded but appears more  angled. White powder may be visible on the
            edges of the film. In this  stage of decay the content may be
            unrecoverable. Acetate-based film in  critical condition often
            cannot safely be played back in-house&mdash;if it  can be played
            back at all. However, depending upon the flexibility of  the film,
            the condition of the emulsion and image area, and shrinkage,
            a highly qualified vendor may be able to recover the content (Image
            Permanence Institute, 2001).
         </p>
         <p>
            In order to slow or stop acetate decay, it should be stored in cold
            to frozen conditions (32-40 degrees F and less than 32 degrees F,
            respectively). Once the decay starts, it cannot be reversed. If a
            film is discovered to be acidic and succumbing to vinegar syndrome,
            it  should be separated from other &quot;healthy&quot; films as it
            can &quot;infect&quot; the  other films (NFPF, 2004).
