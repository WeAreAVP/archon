         <p>
            The gelatin binder in film is an especially good nutrient for mold.
            If  your film is exhibiting white or brown patches or you see a
            lattice-like growth on the edges of the film, you are most likely
            viewing mold. Film stored in hot, humid environments (generally
            above 65% relative humidity) is most vulnerable to mold, mildew and
            fungus contamination. Mold typically damages the edges of a film
            first. If  mold has eaten into the emulsion, the film will be
            noticeably and irreparably damaged, exhibiting feathery-like
            distortions or dull spots on the projected image. Mold on film can
            be removed through cleaning and then storing the film in a cold,
            dry environment (NFPF, 2004).
