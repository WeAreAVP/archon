            Cylinders - Dust and Dirt
         </h2>
         <p>
            Dirt and dust on the surface of a cylinder can be especially
            damaging. A dirty cylinder played back without prior cleaning can
            cause the stylus to collect the debris and drag it through the
            grooves. This can cause irreparable damage to the recording and
            adversely affect playback sound quality. Thus, all recordings should
            be cleaned before playing them back (Gibson, 1987).
