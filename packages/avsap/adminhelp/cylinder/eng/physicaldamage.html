            Cylinders - Physical Damage
         </h2>
         <p class="strong">
            Because of their age and fragility, cylinders will be considered a
            higher preservation priority.
         </p>
         <p>
            Cylinders, especially the oldest wax cylinders, are susceptible to
            damage because of the age of the media and the delicate nature of
            the grooved surface. Surface damage from contaminants, abrasion and
            general decay can result in cracks, pitting, scratches and groove
            degradation, which can affect the quality of the sound and content.
            Additionally, careless playback using improper styli and equipment
            can cause groove destruction. If the cylinder is on a cardboard
            core, check  the core for swelling or damage.
