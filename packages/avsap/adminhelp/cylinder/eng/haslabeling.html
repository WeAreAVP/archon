            If your item has any kind of labeling on the container, the item
            itself, or any related material we highly recommend that you return
            to the General tab under Assessments Manager, and enter this
            information in the notes field.

         <p>
            Correct labeling on a container can offer important clues about what
            is on the cylinder. If you are replacing a container that has
            labeling information, it is important to transfer this information
            to the new  container or label. Container labels should be used with
            caution, however, as containers are frequently reused or switched by
            accident. If there is content information on the container, verify
            it. Content information is often found on the edge of the cylinder,
            if available.
