            Cylinder - Appropriate Container
         </h2>
         <p>
            Containers protect the surface of the recording from dirt, dust,
            mold and vermin. These contaminants can damage the surface of the
            recording, which can affect its sound quality and even render the
            recording unplayable.
            <strong>
               Archival quality boxes are available specifically for cylinders.
            </strong>
            These are small acid-free boxes which often have a cylindrical
            baffle inside. The cylinder is placed on the baffle to secure it
            within the box and to prevent it from excessive movement while in
            storage. Cylinders should be stored in containers &quot;designed to
            support them vertically, bearing the weight at the bottom and
            protecting the surface from any pressure or contact with the
            container&quot; (Warren, 1993, p. 152).

            The container can speak volumes on the storage history of the
            recording. Is it moldy? Does it appear to have water damage? Is it
            falling apart? A container should protect the recording without
            damaging or leaving contaminants on the surface. Original paper
            sleeves may deteriorate and leave fibers, which can abrade the
            delicate recording surface. Since grooved media is especially
            susceptible to damage from dirt and contaminants, it is important
            that these recordings are housed in appropriate containers.
