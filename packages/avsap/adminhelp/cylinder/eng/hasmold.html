            High humidity and temperature in your storage area can foster the
            growth of mold on your cylinders and associated containers. Mold can
            affect the sound quality of a recording and can damage the delicate
            recording surface. Mold typically has a dull, lattice-like
            appearance. Cylinders are susceptible to mold, especially the
            earliest wax cylinders (Library of Congress, 2002). You can identify
            mold if you see whitish, splotchy surface contamination.

            Brown wax cylinder exhibiting some light surface
            contamination&mdash;splotchy, whiteish spots&mdash;may be mold.
