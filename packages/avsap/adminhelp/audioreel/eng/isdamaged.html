         <h2>Open Reel Audio Tape - Physical Damage</h2>
         <p>
            If you load a crumpled or otherwise damaged reel onto a deck, you
            are asking for trouble.
            <strong>
               Continued play of an already damaged tape significantly increases
               the odds of the tape being eaten and/or further damaged by the
               playback machine.
            </strong>
            (Sadly, there are no guarantees that even a pristine tape will not
            be eaten by a machine&mdash;this is why we must preserve playback
            equipment alongside our media.)
         </p>
         <p>
            If your tape is in the fully rewound or fast-forwarded
            position&mdash;which is recommended&mdash;you may see tape leader
            when you look along the tape path. Leader is generally made of
            uncoated polyester tape, and is used to protect the tape. As tape is
            played back, it is most likely to be damaged at the beginning and
            end of the film. If there are any issues with the playback
            equipment, the leader would ideally take the brunt of the damage.
            Damaged leader is easier to replace than unique sections of tape.
