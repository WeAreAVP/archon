         <h2>Open Reel Audio - Appropriate Container</h2>
         <p>
            Containers protect the tape from dirt, dust, mold and vermin.
            These contaminants can damage the surface of the magnetic tape,
            which can affect its sound quality and even render it unplayable.
            Ideally, these  materials should be housed in archival-quality inert
            plastic containers  to avoid damage from non-archival quality boxes.
            An audiotape's container should be clean and protect the tape's
            recording surface. Moldy, damaged, and dirty containers should be
            replaced.
         </p>
         <p>
            <strong>
               If your tape is housed in an acid-free paper or plastic container
               and you're unsure if it is inert or is acceptable for
               preservation purposes, check the condition of the container.
               If it is protecting the tape from dust, pests and other
               contaminants, not shedding or introducing any contaminants
               through its own degradation and is clean and free of mold
               or excessive dirt, the container is acceptable for use.
            </strong>
            Rehousing to a more expensive inert plastic container is not vital
            in this case. If the tape is housed in anything other than a hard
            plastic container, e.g. in a cardboard slipcover, or is not
            sufficiently protected, it should be rehoused in an inert plastic
            container. Additionally, any reel with a slotted hub should be
            replaced.
