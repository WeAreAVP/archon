               Playback carries with it the risk that your tape could be
               irrevocably damaged by the playback and/or that the playback will
               cause damage to the playback machine. For this reason we don't
               recommend playback as a means of assessment; however, a strictly
               visual inspection of a tape will not provide all the clues about
               the tape's sound/picture quality. If this item has been played
               back recently there may be notes indicating the playback quality,
               that is, if there was anything worth noting.
            </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
            If you have any past documentation about playback or tape quality,
            this information can be extremely useful in assessing the tape
            without having to subject it to playback risks. Additionally,
            documentation may provide evidence of past preservation measures
            taken on the content or item. You should always document any
            preservation measures that you take on your materials. This provides
            evidence to future preservationists and researchers about the path
            that the content/object has traveled.
         </p>
         <p>Your documentation should
            <strong>
               NOT
            </strong>
            be stored with the item.
            You should store your documentation (for example, notes written on
            paper) in a separate physical location. Paper has numerous
            conservation issues and can be more damaging than helpful. For
            example, paper can damage your tape by shedding fibers which can
            abrade the tape surface. If you track your items via electronic
            means, you may be able to note preservation history in your
            electronic tracking system.
         </p>
         <p>
            Having additional documentation about your item can help inform your
            future preservation decisions.
