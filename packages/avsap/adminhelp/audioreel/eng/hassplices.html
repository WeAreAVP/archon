         <p class="strong clear">
            You can identify splices by:
         </p>
         <ul class="strong clear">
            <li>
               observing splicing tape on the film surface
            </li>
            <li>
               observing small bumps or tape unevenness when looking at the
               broad side of the tape pack
            </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
            A splice is the location where two pieces of tape are joined.
            Usually, splices are made during editing, although they can be made
            to repair a tape, join two different tape reels or attach leader to
            a film. You can check for splices by looking at the tape pack. If
            you see small bumps or areas where the tape looks thicker, it is
            most likely a splice. Audio tape splices are generally cut on the
            diagonal. If the splice is weak, dirty or has tape residue, the tape
            around the splice should be cleaned and the splice should be removed
            and replaced. To repair splices, you'll need a sharp razor blade, a
            splicing block, and very thin audio splicing tape. If the tape is
            too thick, it will interfere with playback.
