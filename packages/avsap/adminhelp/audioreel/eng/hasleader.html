         <h2>Open Reel Audio - Leader</h2>
         <p>
            <strong>Leader is used to protect the tape and can also be a place
               where pertinent information about a tape can be written.
            </strong>
            It is generally made of uncoated polyester tape. As tape is played
            back, it is most likely to be damaged at the beginning and end of
            the tape.
            <strong>
               Leader should be fairly long (enough to wrap around the reel a
               few times) so that there is sufficient leader to protect the tape
               at the head and the tail.
            </strong>
            If there are any issues with the playback equipment, the leader
            would ideally take the brunt of the damage. Damaged leader is easier
            to replace than unique sections of tape. Dirty or damaged leaders
            should be removed and replaced. If replacing leader which contains
            information, transcribe the information onto the new leader.
