         <h2>Open Reel Audio Tape - Acetate Deterioration</h2>
         <p>
            These ratings have been adapted from the AvSAP ratings for motion
            picture film suffering from vinegar syndrome. When film is suffering
            from vinegar syndrome, we recommend that you freeze the film to slow
            or halt the decay.
            <strong>
               Freezing is not recommended for magnetic tape.
            </strong>
            Freezing tape can cause damage to the information layer of the
            tape&mdash;this is why AvSAP recommends storing acetate-based
            audiotape in cool, not frozen conditions.
         </p>
         <p>
            <strong>
               No Deterioration.
            </strong>
            This tape is suffering from no acetate decay.
         </p>
         <p>
            <strong>
               Deterioration Starting.
            </strong>
            Acetate decay is starting. This tape should be monitored and kept
            in carefully monitored conditions. The tape is flexible, with little
            (less than 1%) to no apparent shrinkage. There  may be a very faint
            vinegar smell.

            <strong>
               Actively Deteriorating.
            </strong>
            This tape is actively deteriorating. It should be moved to
            carefully monitored conditions if possible and duplicated.
            The tape will have a stronger vinegar odor and may exhibit shrinkage
            (between .8 to 2%). The tape may be able to be accessed and played
            back in-house by an experienced technician using maintained and
            functioning equipment. The tape will also exhibit some waviness
            along the edges; it may curl slightly and resist lying flat
            (NFPF, 2004).

               Critical Deterioration.
            </strong>
            This tape is exhibiting shrinkage and warping. It may be difficult
            or impossible to handle the tape without damaging it. The tape
            should be moved to carefully monitored conditions, if possible.
            The vinegar odor is unmistakable. The tape is likely to be damaged
            during playback&mdash;if it can be played back at all. It may be
            possible for a trained vendor to recover information off the tape.
