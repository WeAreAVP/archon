         <p>
            <strong>
               MOLD CAN BE TOXIC. Proceed with caution when examining tapes for
               mold. Do not handle moldy tapes longer than necessary. If you
               find a moldy tape place it in a sealable plastic bag until
               conservation action can be taken. If you see white or brown
               patches or strands on the tape, chances are  that you are
               dealing with mold.
            </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
            Inspecting the tape's container is also a good idea&mdash;if you
            see mold, it is likely that the mold has traveled onto the tape as
            well.
            <strong>
               Tapes suspected of being moldy should NOT be played back
            </strong>
            as the mold can get into the playback machinery and cause poor
            playback. Mold can also travel onto other tapes, so it is best to
            quarantine any tapes suspected of being moldy.
            <strong>
               Mold is very difficult to clean off of video and audiotapes,
               particularly cassette-based tapes, and will need to be
               professionally cleaned.
            </strong>
            This is not something you will want to do in-house (Wheeler, 2002).
