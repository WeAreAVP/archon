            Cassettes of longer length have thinner tape, which
            makes them more susceptible to stretching, snapping or other damage
            during playback. Cassettes that are 90 minutes or longer are also
            more subject to print-through, in which an echo (either pre- or
            post-) may be heard when the tape is played.
            <strong>
               Valuable tapes recorded on longer cassette are a higher
               preservation risk.
            </strong>
            Commercially produced pre-recorded audiocassettes are generally 30
            minutes in length. Blank, recordable tapes tend to vary more. On
            blank recordable tapes, lengths are generally indicated somewhere on
            the cassette shell.
