            Audiocassette - Appropriate Container
         </h2>
         <p>
            Containers protect the cassette from dirt, dust, mold and vermin. 
            These contaminants can damage the surface of the magnetic tape,
            which can affect its sound quality and even render it unplayable.
            Ideally, a cassette should be housed in an inert waterproof plastic
            container. An audiotape's container should be clean and protect the
            tape's recording surface. Moldy, damaged and dirty containers should
            be replaced. The container may provide clues as to how the item has
            been previously cared for. A dirty, damaged container may be an
            indication that the tape is in need of preservation care, especially
            if the container is not providing adequate protection for the tape's
            recording surface.
         </p>

            <strong>
               If your audiocassette is housed in a plastic container and you're
               unsure if it is inert, or is acceptable for preservation purposes
               check the condition of the container. If it is protecting the
               tape from dust, pests and other contaminants, not shedding or
               introducing any contaminants through its own degradation, and is
               clean and free of mold or excessive dirt, the container is
               acceptable for use.
            </strong>
            Rehousing to a more expensive inert plastic container is not vital 
            in this case. If the tape is housed in anything other than a hard
            plastic container, e.g. in a cardboard slipcover, or is not
            sufficiently protected it should be rehoused in an inert plastic
            container.
