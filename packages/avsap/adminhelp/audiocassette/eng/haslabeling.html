            Labeling
         </h2>
         <p class="strong">
            If your item has any kind of labeling on the container, the item
            itself, or any related material we highly recommend that you return
            to the General tab under Assessments Manager, and enter this
            information in the notes field.
         </p>
         <p>
            Unidentified tapes have a tendency to get overlooked or shuffled to
            the back of the shelf. Basic information should be recorded on a
            label both on the tape itself and on the tape's container.
            Information like title, creator, alphanumeric identifier (whatever
            your institution uses&mdash;accession number, catalog number, and
            so on), and date information (whatever your institution
            uses&mdash;the date the tape was received, the date the tape was
            recorded, etc.). Bear in mind that describing your materials, both
            on the containers and in a catalog, helps to keep the materials
            accessible. When you cannot find something, you are less likely to
            devote time, effort and funds to its preservation.
         </p>
         <p>
            Additionally, if you are considering re-housing your tape, you
            should transfer or retain the labeling and notes (if extant) of the
            original container. These notes may be helpful to a future
            researcher.
