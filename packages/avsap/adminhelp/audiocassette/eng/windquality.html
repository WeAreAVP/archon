         <p class="strong">
            All video and audiotapes should exhibit a tight, even tape pack.
            This means that when you look at the tape it itself you should
            not see &quot;windows&quot;, or large gaps through the pack.
            Additionally, if you look at the tape from a slight angle
            (usually through the clear or translucent window in the
            cassette), you notice no strands of tape that are standing higher
            than the rest of the wound tape. These strands of tape are
            referred to as &quot;popped strands.&quot;
         </p>

         <p>
            A tape will show popped strands if the tape is damaged or warped,
            the tape has been stored without being completely rewound or
            fast-forwarded, or if the playback deck plays, rewinds or
            fast-forwards in a less-than-uniform speed. Caution should be
            exercised when playing back a tape without a uniform tape pack, as
            it could indicate a problem that will be exacerbated by playing it
            back&mdash;sometimes with disastrous results.
            <strong>
               Checking the tape pack should be a step taken before playing
               back any tape.
            </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
            Many institutions, including the Library of Congress,
            <strong>
               recommend storing all tapes (audio or video) in the fully
               fast-forwarded position.
            </strong>
            This can prevent tape pack issues while the tape is in storage and
            will also force you to fully rewind a tape before playing it back
            (called &quot;exercising&quot; the tape), which can help keep a tape
            in good shape. Some institutions also create a schedule whereby all
            tapes that are in good enough condition are taken from the shelf and
            fully rewound and then fast-forwarded. Making it a point to
            periodically exercise tapes that are not exhibiting problems can
            help keep these tapes in good condition.
