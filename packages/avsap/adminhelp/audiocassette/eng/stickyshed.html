            Sticky Shed Syndrome (Binder Hydrolysis)
         </h2>
         <p>
            Magnetic tape is made of at least three layers. The first is the
            plastic tape layer, which is the base upon which the other layers
            are supported. The topmost layer is the recording layer, which
            contains the metal particles that carry recorded information.
            Between these two layers is a binder layer, which keeps the
            recording layer adhered to the base layer. Sticky shed syndrome,
            also known as binder hydrolysis, is a situation in which the binder
            layer has taken on moisture from the environment and starts to break
            down. Sticky shed is very common and can be difficult to diagnose by
            eye. It can be present as a whitish powder on the tape, but it can
            also be invisible. During playback, sticky shed can cause the tape
            to squeal and can distort the audio and/or video. Playing back a
            tape suffering from sticky shed syndrome can cause the binder
            material to flake off and gum up the heads and other parts of your
            playback deck.

            Almost all magnetic tape can suffer from sticky shed syndrome. This
            is an example of inherent vice, a situation in which the very design
            of an information recording medium carries within it the seeds of
            its own demise. Some brands of audio or videotape are more
            susceptible to sticky shed than others; however, we must do our best
            to control and monitor the storage environment for all of our
            magnetic media to slow down incidences of sticky shed syndrome.
            Controlling humidity levels is essential for preventing the
            syndrome. Variances in humidity and temperature should always be
            avoided, as these variances can also prematurely age materials.
            Generally speaking, it is best to move audiovisual materials from
            the attic, shed, basement or other environment that does not
            maintain constant temperature and relative humidity throughout the
            year. According to the Library of Congress (2002), magnetic tapes
            should be stored at 45 to 50 degrees F and 20 to 30% relative
            humidity (RH). Storing tape at below 45% RH is not advisable as it
            can break down the lubrication that is built into the tape. While
            film likes to be frozen for long-term storage, magnetic tape does
            not. Many experts agree that controlling the humidity in which
            magnetic tapes are stored is more important than controlling the
            temperature (Clark, 2002).

            Remember that magnetic tapes that squeal during playback, show
            powdery or flaky material on the tape, or have been stored in very
            humid conditions could be suffering from sticky shed syndrome and
            should not be played back. Such tapes can in some cases be
            temporarily treated by being baked at low levels (like dehydrating
            food). When a tape is baked successfully, it can usually be played
            back one time, which is usually enough to transfer the information
            off of the bad tape and onto a new medium. While baking can be very
            effective, we do not recommend you try to do this yourself. Instead,
            contact a professional audiovisual restoration facility. Only open
            reel audio tapes can be treated in this manner. DO NOT attempt this
            with audio cassettes.
