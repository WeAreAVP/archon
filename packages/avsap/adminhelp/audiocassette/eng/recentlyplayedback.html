         </h2>
         <p>
            It is often difficult to truly assess a tape without playing it
            back. It is entirely possible to have a tape that, to the eye,
            appears to be in good condition but when played has very bad sound
            quality.
            <strong>
               The only way to truly assess a tape's quality is to play it back.
               Playback, however, carries with it the risk that your tape could
               be irrevocably damaged and/or could cause damage to the playback
               machine.
            </strong>
            For this reason, we
            <strong>
               do not recommend playback
            </strong>
            as a means of assessment. However, if you do play a tape and find
            that the sound quality is poor, it likely means the tape is in need
            of reformatting. If this item has been played back recently, there
            may be notes indicating the playback quality.
