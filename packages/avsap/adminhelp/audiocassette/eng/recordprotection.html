            <strong>
               It is very important to copy-protect your cassettes. This is
               probably the single best thing you should do (and the first thing
               you should do) to protect your audiocassettes!
            </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
            With an audiocassette, the record protection tab is your best
            friend. This is a piece of plastic that is removed in order to
            protect your cassette from accidental erasure or copying over while
            in its playback machine. This should be the first thing you do with
            your audiocassettes in order to protect them from accidental
            information loss.
            <strong>
               If you are assessing a tape and notice that the record protection
               tab is not removed or in the &quot;save&quot; position, do it
               now!
            </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
            The protection tab is in the upper corner of your cassette, opposite
            the end consisting of the tape path. There is a tab for each side of
            the cassette. You should remove both of these tabs in order to
            protect both sides of the cassette.
