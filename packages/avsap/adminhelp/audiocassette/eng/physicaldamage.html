            <strong>
               Before playback, thoroughly inspect the tape each time.
            </strong>
            Look through the cassette window at the quality of the tape wind.
            Does it seem uneven? Does the tape look twisted within the shell?
            Look at the tape track&mdash;is the tape rumpled? These may be
            indicators of physical damage which may not be immediately apparent.

            If you load a crumpled or otherwise damaged audiocassette into a
            deck, you are asking for trouble because you are significantly
            increasing the odds of the tape being eaten and/or further damaged
            by the playback machine. Sadly, there are no guarantees that even a
            pristine tape will not be eaten by a machine&mdash;this is why we
            must preserve playback equipment alongside our media. However, there
            is no guarantee that even a well maintained machine will not damage
            an item that is played on it.
            <strong>
               Exercise caution every time an item is played back. Original
               materials should rarely, if ever, be played back.
