         <h2>Orientation in Storage</h2>
         <p>While in storage, the orientation of a cassette can affect its
            long-term well-being.
            <strong>
               The best orientation for cassettes is vertical and
               &quot;on edge&quot;
            </strong>
            (Library of Congress, 2006).

            Audiocassettes and cartridges, generally speaking,
            like to be stored upright on shelves like books. Piling tapes one
            upon the other tends to stress the cassettes at the bottom of the
            stack. This can, over time, cause the plastic housing of the
            cartridges to warp and even crack, leading to poor playback.
            Tapes that have been stacked one upon the other for long periods
            should be closely inspected for cracks and fractures before
            playback. Storing tapes in their case and upright also helps to
            protect the cassette within from water damage (water can flow off
            the case without pooling inside it) as well as from dust and dirt.
