            Optical Media - Data Checks
         </h2>
         <p>
            Data on a CD or DVD, especially a non-replicated
            recordable/re-writable CD or DVD, is subject to loss over time. All
            optical media should be regularly checked for data degradation. As
            "there is no (measurable) deterioration by replay with optical
            disks" (Schuller, 2008), error checking and testing is a
            "mandatory part of storing data on a recordable disc"
            (Bradley, 2006, p. 11).
         </p>
         <p>
            There are several classes of optical media testers. The most
            accurate are production-quality, standalone testers which can start
            at approximately $30,000. The next are mid-range production quality
            testers, with a starting price of approximately $3,000 (in 2006).
            These systems require regular calibration and maintenance for
            consistent accuracy. All mid priced systems should be regularly
            calibrated against a known standard. Currently, a major manufacturer
            of such mid range testers is Clover Systems 
            (<a href="http://www.cloversystems.com/">http://www.cloversystems.com/</a>)
            (Bradley, 2006). The least reliable are downloadable software
            program testers. These programs "use a computer's inbuilt CD/DVD
            drive to measure error in written CD and DVDs" (Bradley, 2006).
            However, due to several limitations with the software and hardware,
            they are not recommended for archival purposes.

            To reiterate, optical media, especially recordable media, is
            volatile and subject to sudden failure, so testing is a critical
            component. In a report published by UNESCO, Bradley (2006) states:
            "Test your newly recorded discs. If a CD test program is beyond
            budget, choose a different storage medium" (p. 12). This shows how
            important it is to test your optical media.
