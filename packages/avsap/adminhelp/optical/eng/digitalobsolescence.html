            Digital Obsolescence
         </h2>
         <p>
            It is often difficult to truly assess an optical disc without
            playing it back. It is entirely possible to have a disc that, to the
            eye, appears to be in good condition, but when played is either
            unplayable or has degraded sound or image quality. The only way to
            truly assess an optical disc's quality is to play it back. There is
            considerable less risk in playing back an optical disc than other
            media. If this item has been played back recently, there may be
            notes indicating the playback quality.

            You should always document any preservation measures that you take
            on your materials. This provides evidence to future preservationists
            and researchers about the path that the content/object has traveled.
            Your documentation should NOT be stored with the item. You should
            store your documentation (for example, notes written on paper) in a
            separate physical location. Paper has numerous conservation issues
            and can be more damaging than helpful. For example, paper can damage
            your item by shedding fibers which can abrade the item surface. If 
            you track your items via electronic means, you may  be able to note
            preservation history in your electronic tracking system.
         </p>

            Having additional documentation  about your item can help inform 
            your future preservation decisions.

         <h4>
            Digital Preservation:
         </h4>
         <p>
            Digital preservation requires the maintenance of bits and metadata
            which compose a file to a level sufficient to produce a suitable
            facsimile of the original and for continued accessibility of the
            documents in  perpetuity. (Jantz, 2005). Although optical discs are
            one of the most recent audiovisual technologies they are still
            vulnerable to obsolescence. Digital obsolescence may be more
            dramatic and catastrophic than analog obsolescence due  to a number
            of factors: the hardware to read the disc may become obsolete, the
            software needed to access the files on the disc may become obsolete,
            and the  operating system on which the hardware and software run may
            become obsolete. The disc itself is subject to rapid and
            catastrophic failure as it can fail without warning, and with little
            physical indication of trouble. For these  reasons, optical discs
            and the technology employed to make them usable require  more
            frequent playback and maintenance to ensure their continued
            viability.
         </p>
         <p>
            Presently, there are a few methods employed to preserve digital
            objects.
         </p>
         <h4>
            Migration:
         </h4>
         <p>
            Migration is the transferring of digital objects from one format to
            a more comtemporary, archival-level format. Preserving Digital
            Information defines migration as &quot;the periodic transfer of
            digital materials from one hardware/software configuration to
            another, or from one  generation of computer technology to a
            subsequent generation&quot; ((Task Force  on Archiving of Digital
            Information, 1996). Although migration has a number of  advantages
            it is not without risk. For example, a file created in a particular
            application may not be readable in later versions of the same
            application. In  order to mitigate some of the risks in migration it
            is highly recommended that  your media files are standard formats
            certified by standards groups, widely  deployed and non-proprietary.
         </p>
         <h4>
            Use non-proprietary and/or standard formats:
         </h4>
         <p>
            Non-proprietary formats are file formats in which the file
            specification is freely available and open for modification without
            violating  patent or copyright. Proprietary formats, however, are
            covered by copyright and  patent and are under the exclusive control
            of the licensce holder. This means  that future efforts to emulate a
            file format for preservation purposes may not  be legal. However,
            there are a few preservation formats which are not
         </p>
         <h4>
            Emulation:
         </h4>
         <p>
            Compared to migration, emulation is a more complex process. In
            emulation the “preservation effort  is not focused on the digital
            object, but on the hard- and software environment in which the
            object is rendered. It aims at (re)creating the environment in
            which the digital object was originally created” (van der Hoeven,
            Lohman, and  Verdegem, 2007). Emulation requires programming
            expertise to re-engineer the original software or hardware
            environment.
