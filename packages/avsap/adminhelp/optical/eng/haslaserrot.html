            Optical Media - Laser Rot
         </h2>
         <p>
            Early optical discs may have some inherent vice within the materials
            of the discs. Signal-loss due to inherent vice occurs less
            frequently in later CDs and DVDs. If the seal encasing the aluminum
            recording surface is compromised, the aluminum layer can oxidize,
            resulting in data loss. This deterioration is colloquially referred
            to as disc rot or laser rot.
            <strong>
               Some observable indications of disc rot are pin-sized holes in
               the reflective layer, a bronze coloring on the non-labeled side
               of the disc, and crazing.
            </strong>
            Crazing can be seen in snowflake-like or fractal-like milky-white
            patterns on the disc. Crazing typically only affects early CDs,
            because as manufacturing processes improved, the issue became less
            of a problem.
