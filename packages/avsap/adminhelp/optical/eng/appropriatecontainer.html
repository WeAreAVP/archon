            Inert plastic containers with a non-damaging center hub are
            recommended. Original packaging for optical media, especially DVDs,
            can be less than desirable as the hubs may be too large or require
            excessive pressure to be applied in order to remove the disc.
            However, if the origianl container

               If your disc is housed in a plastic container and you're unsure
               if it is inert, or is acceptable for preservation purposes check
               the condition of the container. If it is protecting the disc from
               dust and other contaminants, not shedding or introducing any
               contaminants through its own degradation, and is clean and free
               of mold, or excessive dirt the container is acceptable for use.
