         <p class="clear">
            Keeping collections secure often means mediating public access to
            materials. The more control you have over your audiovisual
            information, the more you can protect them from damage. Circulating
            collections take the most abuse and are consequently the most
            potentially at-risk for damage. For our purposes, we will lay out
            the following levels of access:
         </p>
         <ul class="clear">
            <li>
               <strong>
                  High security:
               </strong>
               these are collections that are kept locked away from public
               access. These materials are rarely, if ever, used and only by
               trained staff. The public cannot play back these materials on
               their own. These materials are at very low risk of theft.
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>
                  Moderate security:
               </strong>
               these are collections to which the public has mediated access.
               Users can view or listen to these materials  in a monitored
               environment, such as a reading room or designated
               viewing/listening space. The public can play back these materials
               with help from trained staff and are monitored while doing so.
               These materials are at moderate risk for theft.
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>
                  No security:
               </strong>
               these are collections that are stored in public areas. The public
               can take these materials home and play them back on their own
               equipment in unmonitored environments. These materials are at
               high risk for theft.
            </li>
