            Average Temperature

            Regulating temperature is very important for lengthening the viable
            lives of your audiovisual items. According to the Image Permanence
            Institute, the following are the optimal temperature ranges for some
            of the audiovisual media types:
         </p><ul class="clear">

               Low-use motion picture film should be stored frozen if possible.
               You can keep these items below freezing in a frost-free freezer.
               It is best to keep the films double-bagged in plastic bags in
               order to keep condensation from developing on them. This is best
               for low-use materials because it is necessary to "stage" them or
               allow them to slowly come up to room temperature before use.
               Failure to stage these films can lead to breakage as the film
               will not be as supple as it needs to be for playback until it
               comes up to temperature. Frozen film can also accumulate
               condensation if it is not allowed to come up to temperature
               slowly, usually over a 24 hour period.
            </li>

               If you cannot store motion picture film frozen, it is best to
               store it in as cold an environment as possible. Ideally film
               should be stored under 36 degrees Fahrenheit. The closest you can
               get your film collections to these conditions, the longer the
               films will be viable.
            </li>
            <li>
               Unlike motion picture film, magnetic video and audiotape should
               not be stored frozen. Freezing magnetic tape can be damaging to
               it. That said, cold conditions are good for magnetic tape in
               terms of prolonging its longevity. Keeping your magnetic tape
               below 52 degrees Fahrenheit can possibly lead to damage to the
               tape so it is best to keep tapes above 52 degrees and below room
               temperature.
            </li>
            <li>
               Like magnetic tape, optical media like CDs and DVDs should be
               kept cold but not frozen. Keeping your optical media below 70
               degrees Fahrenheit is best.
            </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
            Remember that these are optimal storage temperatures and may not
            reflect what you are able to do in your storage facilities. The
            closer you can get to these conditoins the better. Keep in mind that
            variations in temperature are what we are really trying to avoid.
            Keeping your materials at steady temperatures, even if these aren't
            perfect, will still help grant them longer life. You should also
            consider how to arrange your collections. Since different formats
            have different needs you may consider how you can store them
            separately so as to properly match an item with an environment.
            Don't be discouraged! These conditions should be the goal that you
            are moving toward, even if you can't always achieve them.
