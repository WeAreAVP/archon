            Temperature Variance
         </h2>
         <p>
            Variations in temperature can cause your AV materials to expand and
            contract which can age these materials over time. It is best to keep
            temperatures in your storage facilities as steady as possible so as
            to lengthen the viable lives of these items. Even if you cannot
            maintain the best possible storage temperatures for your materials,
            it is still helpful to minimize the variances as much as you can.
