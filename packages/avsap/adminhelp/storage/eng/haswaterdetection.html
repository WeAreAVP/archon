            Water Drainage
         </h2>
         <p>
            Standing water can be very hazardous to your collections, especially
            those stored on the floor or on lower shelves. Water can break down
            materials and encourage mold growth. As a rule it is best to store
            materials up above the bottom two or three shelves in your stacks
            where space permits. It is also a good idea to have drains in the
            floors where practical so as to discourage standing water.
