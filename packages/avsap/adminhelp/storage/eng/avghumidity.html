            Average Humidity
         </h2>
         <p class="clear">
            Humidity, along with temperature, is one of the most important and
            potentially damaging factors in your storage environment.
            Maintaining a stable relative humidity can help increase the viable
            lives of your audiovisual media. Changes in humidity can cause AV
            items to swell and contract, encourage the growth of mold, and speed
            up or even cause chemical decay. The following are the relative
            humidity standards for several format types:
         </p>
         <ul class="clear">
            <li>
               Motion picture film (color or black and white) should be stored
               between 30% and 50% relative humidity. Storing it below 30% will
               cause the film to get too dry and lose its suppleness. Film must
               be flexible in order to travel through projectors and printing
               machines. If it gets too dry it can crack and break. Storing
               acetate film and nitrate film above 50% can increase acetate
               decay (vinegar syndrome) and nitrate decay, respectively. All
               film bases stored at about 50% relative humidity become more
               susceptible to mold infestation.
            </li>
            <li>
               Magnetic video and audiotape should also be stored between 30%
               and 50% relative humidity. If magnetic tape gets too dry, its
               lubricant can freeze and the tape will have difficulty moving
               through playback equipment. If tape is stored above 50% relative
               humidity, it can become more susceptible to sticky shed syndrome
               and mold.
            </li>
            <li>
               Grooved audio media should be stored at a relative humidity
               around 45% (Warren, 1993, p. 138)
            </li>
            <li>
               Optical media like CDs and DVDs should be stored at a relative
               humidity between 30% and 50%. Relative humidity levels above 50%
               can cause corrosion and mold growth.
            </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
            Keeping your audiovisual materials between 30% and 50% relative
            humidity is ideal. It is important to remember, however, that often
            when you lower the temperature, you raise the relative humidity.
            This is why it is critical to monitor the humidity and temperature
            in your storage facilities. It is best to keep your media from wide
            variances in temperature and relative humidity, even if you can't
            completely control both of these factors. It is also good to keep
            your media away from extremes&mdash;very low or very high humidity.
            Bringing materials out of uncontrolled environments like basements,
            sheds, and attics and moving them into climate controlled areas like
            internal rooms or even closets can do much to keep these materials
            viable.
