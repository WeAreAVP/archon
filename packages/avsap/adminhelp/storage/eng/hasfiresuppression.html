            Fire Suppression
         </h2>
         <p>
            Fire suppression systems are critical in a storage area. There are
            many types of fire suppression systems, but two of the most common
            are water sprinkler systems and halon systems. Each has its benefits
            and drawbacks. Water sprinklers are cheaper and more common. Yet
            repositories are often concerned about water sprinklers because it
            is assumed that these systems tend to turn all the sprinklers on in
            the event of a fire, causing more widespread water damage to
            collections than necessary. Research has proved this to be untrue,
            however; in fact, sprinkler systems tend to be able to focus their
            fire suppression very closely by turning on only a sprinkler or two
            over the fire (Artim, 1993). Water systems are also cheaper to
            maintain and upgrade. Halon systems, on the other hand, are
            preferred by many institutions because halon gas can extinguish
            fires without leaving any damaging residue. They can be very
            expensive, however, and replenishing the supply of halon gas is
            costly as well.

            Institutions should not fear water systems. When properly
            maintained, they can be very effective and minimally damaging to
            collections. Water is also not damaging to the environment, whereas
            halon gas is environmentally damaging. Water damage to materials is
            often not the end of the world for your collection&mdash;there are
            many effective techniques for treating water damage and there are
            several excellent audiovisual disaster recovery specialists who can
            help, should your sprinklers douse your materials.
         </p>

            Whatever system you choose for your institution, proper maintenance
            and upgrades are critical to maintain the long-term effectiveness of
            your fire suppression system. It is also very important that you
            check with your local building codes to see what you will be allowed
            to use in your facility. Some states or counties have laws that
            restrict the kinds of chemicals that can be used in your fire
            suppression systems.
         </p>
         <p>Having easily accessible hand fire extinguishers throughout your
            storage facilities is critical when responding to a fire.
            Extinguishers should be recharged and/or inspected regularly to make
            sure they are functional.
