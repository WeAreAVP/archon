            Fire Detection
         </h2>
         <p>
            Fire is one of the most damaging disasters to a repository. Having
            fire detection systems throughout every storage facility is critical
            in order to help prevent loss. A good smoke detector can alert staff
            before a fire gets large enough to set off the fire suppression
            system. This can give staff time to put out the fire before
            materials are exposed to the water or chemicals dispersed by the
            fire suppression system. Detection systems should be tested
            regularly to make sure they are functional.
