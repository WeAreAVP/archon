            Risks of Storing Materials on the Floor
         </h2>
         <p>
            Storing materials on the floor can put them at high risk of danger
            should you have flooding in this storage facility. Flooding and
            water damage can be caused by Mother Nature but can also be caused
            by broken pipes or spills, so even if you do not live on a flood
            plain, you should still be concerned about water damage. It is a
            good idea to keep your materials not just up off the floor but on
            the higher shelves in your storage area. Leave the bottom couple
            shelves free of collections materials so as to minimize the risk of
            flood damage.
