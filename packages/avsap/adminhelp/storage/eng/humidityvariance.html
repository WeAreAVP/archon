            Humidity Variance
         </h2>
         <p>
            As with temperature, variations in relative humidity can cause your
            AV materials to expand and contract, which can age these materials
            over time. It is best to keep the humidity in your storage
            facilities as steady as possible. Even if you cannot maintain the
            best possible relative humidity levels for your materials, it is
            still helpful to minimize the variances as much as you can.
