               Analog recording (also Analogue recording)
            </strong>
            &ndash; 1. A method of recording in which a characteristic of the
            recorded current, such as amplitude or frequency, is continuously
            varied in a manner analogous to the variations of the original
            signal. 2. A logging of an event by one of various methods of
            capturing and storing a continuous replica of the source sound
            pattern by tracing an analogous pattern into another medium. The
            most commonly used storage methods have been: engraved or embossed
            modulated grooves in a disc, magnetic particle patterns in tape,
            and optical patterns in film (Miliano &amp; IASA, 1999). 3. A
            recording in which continuous magnetic signals, which are
            representations of the voltage signals from the video camera or
            microphone, are written to tape. Analog signals stored on tape
            deteriorate with each copy or generation (in contrast, see Digital)
            (Bay Area Video Coalition, 2009).

            naturally occur in the recording process and must be eliminated in
            order to achieve a high quality image. Most common artifacts include
            cross-color and cross-luminance. Not to be confused with artifact as

               Backing film (also Substrate)
            </strong>
            &ndash; The layer that supports the magnetic layer in a magnetic

               Baking
            </strong>
            &ndash; The process of gently heating damaged videotape in an oven
            in order to enable playback. The polymer of the magnetic tape's
            binder deteriorates by hydrolysis, resulting in sticky shed
            syndrome. Archivists have reported success in baking tapes that are
            suffering from severe sticky shed syndrome; however, scientific
            research has not been conducted to explain this. The temperature and
            humidity of the oven must be tightly controlled, as well as the time
            in which a tape is baked. This process is not recommended except in
            extreme circumstances, as it may accelerate the deterioration of the
            tape. When a tape is baked successfully, it can usually be played
            back one time for remastering (Bay Area Video Coalition, 2009).

            adhere them to the tape substrate. A substance used to hold
            disparate components together in a solid or to give even consistency
            to a liquid (Pearce-Moses, 2005). See image.

               Bit (short for Binary digit)
            </strong>
            &ndash; The smallest unit of information in a binary system. A
            number in base 2, which can be represented using only two numeric
            symbols: a zero and one (National Film and Sound Archive, 2007).
            Eight bits equals one byte. There are 256 possible combinations for
            eight binary digits; thus, the color depth of eight bits represents
            256 possible colors (2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2). Because each pixel of a video
            picture contains 3 samples (Y', R-Y', B-Y'), there are 16.7 million
            (256 x 256 x 256) possible colors in an 8-bit system (Bay Area Video
            Coalition, 2009).

               Blocking
            </strong>
            &ndash; The sticking together or adhesion of successive windings in
            a tape pack. Blocking can result from deterioration of the binder,
            storage of tape reels at high temperatures, and/or excessive tape
            pack stresses (Bay Area Video Coalition, 2009).

            Copyright protects the owner's interests in the intellectual
            property (content), rather than in the physical property that serves
            as a container for the content. For example, an archives may own a

            copyright can be transferred or inherited; hence, the owner of a
            work's copyright may not be the work's creator. These works may be
            in a wide range of media, including literary works; musical works,
            including any accompanying words; dramatic works, including any
            accompanying music; pantomimes and choreographic works; pictorial,

            &ndash; The process of maintaining, in a condition suitable for use,
            materials produced in digital formats, including preservation of the
            bit stream and the continued ability to render or display the
            content represented by the bit stream. The task is compounded by the
            fact that some digital storage media deteriorate quickly (&quot;bit
            rot&quot;), and the digital object is inextricably entwined with its
            access environment (software and hardware), which is evolving in a
            continuous cycle of innovation and obsolescence. Also refers to the
            practice of digitizing materials originally produced in nondigital
            formats (print, film, etc.) to prevent permanent loss due to
            deterioration of the physical medium (Reitz, 2007).

            Notes: The word &quot;digitized&quot; distinguishes materials that
            have been transformed from the media in which they were created from
            materials that are born digital. Digitization is distinguished from

            Digitization may start with information that is in electronic or 
            physical form, for example magnetic audio tape or phonograph discs.
            Digitization of textual documents typically produces an image of the
            words, which must be transformed into character data through a
            process of optical character recognition (OCR). In some instances,
            the OCR process may preserve text and page formatting (Pearce-Moses,

               DVD (abbreviation for Digital Versatile Disc)
            </strong>
            &ndash; There are a number of different types of DVDs, which include
            DVD-R, DVD-ROM, DVD-RAM, DVD+RW, and DVD-RW. DVD is not a suitable
            archival format for video, mainly because it uses a lossy form of
            compression (MPEG2). It is also a format that is likely to see rapid
            changes in technology, which makes the risk of its obsolescence very
            high. DVDs are made up of a reflective aluminum layer, a
            polycarbonate substrate, a dye layer, and a clear lacquer layer.
            While the aluminum layer is highly susceptible to pollution, the
            lacquer layer does not sufficiently protect it from oxidizing.
            Double sided DVDs are bonded using an adhesive&mdash; the life
            expectancy of which is unknown. A DVD is the same diameter as a CD
            (120cm) but cannot be read by the same equipment. DVDs and CDs both
            encode data as tiny pits in tracks that correspond to the zeros and
            ones of binary digits. A laser reads and plays back the information
            encoded on the pits. DVDs are able to store more data than CDs by
            making the pits smaller, the tracks closer together, and by
            compressing the data using MPEG2. DVD-R discs were introduced in
            1997 with a 3.95 GB capacity and a track pitch of 0.8 microns; the
            capacity was later increased to 4.7 GB by reducing the track pitch
            to 0.74 microns.
         </p>
         <p>
            Many artists now use DVD-R as an exhibition format, which has 
            replaced laser disc as a popular display format for many museums and
            galleries. However, because of the way the data is encoded, it
            cannot achieve frame accurate control to reference the picture
            content (as it can with laser disc). Where external control is
            needed for display, it is important clarify any specific
            requirements of the control system before having the disc(s) made.
         </p>
         <p>
            There are two types of DVD-R discs: &quot;General&quot; and 
            &quot;Authoring.&quot; This has caused some compatibility issues, as
            the lasers in the discs' players need to be angled differently.
            Professional DVD players will have both lasers; however if you are
            using a domestic model, it is important to check which discs your
            player is compatible with. This is also true for all other types of
            discs. DVD is a rapidly developing technology and there is a
            continued push to increase the amount of data that can be stored on
            a disc (Bay Area Video Coalition, 2009).

               Grooved-disc audio
            </strong>An analog recording format composed of a disc of varying
            material (shellac-type resins, plastics, etc.) that contain
            information encoded in grooves. The grooves are channel cut,
            embossed, or pressed into a recording medium (i.e. cylinder, disc,
            film) that carries the encoded signal. Such a groove may be blank
            (unmodulated), recorded (modulated), or a combination of both. A cut
            recording contains only one groove cut, or embossed, spirally from
            the beginning to the end of the item, but it is more common to refer
            to this groove in the plural: grooves (Pearce-Moses, 2005). Discs
            may be of the older coarse groove type or microgroove. See also
            Coarse Groove; Micro Groove.

            (through scission or a chemical bond) and becomes a different
            substance. The chemical bonds in the polyester binder polymers of
            tape are subject to hydrolysis, producing alcohol and acid end
            groups. Hydrolysis is a reversible reaction, meaning that the
            alcohol and acid groups can react with each other to produce a
            polyester bond as a byproduct. In practice, however, a severely

               Stick slip

            &ndash; The process in which 1. the tape sticks to the recording
            head because of high friction; 2. the tape tension builds because
            the tape is not moving at the head; 3. the tape tension level
            reaches a critical level, causing the tape to release from and
            briefly slip past the read head at high speed; 4. the tape slows
            to normal speed and once again sticks to the recording head. It is a
            process that is repeated indefinitely and is characterized by
            jittery movement of the tape in the transport and/or audible
            squealing of the tape (Bay Area Video Coalition, 2009).

               Sticky shed syndrome (also Binder hydrolysis)
            </strong>
            &ndash; A condition resulting from the deterioration of the binder
            in magnetic tape that results in gummy residues on tape heads during
            playback (Pearce-Moses, 2005). The phenomenon whereby a tape binder
            has deteriorated to such a degree that it lacks sufficient cohesive
            strength so that the magnetic coating sheds on playback. The
            shedding of particles by the tape is a result of binder
            deterioration that causes dropout on VHS tapes (Bay Area Video
            Coalition, 2009).

               Streaming (media)

            &ndash; A technology for transferring data so that it can be
            received and processed in a steady stream (Dictonary.com, n.d.). A
            method of sending a sequence of compressed audio or moving images
            one way over a data network, at the user's request or broadcast at a
            fixed time, which allows listening/viewing to begin before the
            entire file has been transmitted. To counteract any delays caused by
            packet switching and to maintain the impression of continuous
            motion, a buffer on the client computer is used to store a few
            seconds of content before it is displayed on the screen. Unlike
            content that is downloaded for subsequent playback, streaming
            audio/video is stored as a temporaryfile and deleted when the
            application used to view it is closed. Videoconferencing differs
            from streaming video in providing two-way transmission in real time
            (Reitz, 2007).

            the acetate is catalyzed further by the presence of acetic acid. The
            reaction is autocatalytic, feeding on itself and speeding up over
