                     </span>
                     This moving image format consists of photochemical emulsion
                     (color or black and white) on translucent plastic backing
                     with sprocket holes running down one or both sides of the
                     film strip; the strip may contain an optical or magnetic
                     soundtrack. The width (or "gauge") of this film format is
                     35mm. It is a format not very commonly found in libraries
                     but can turn up in museums and archives.

                        History
                     </span>
                     Thirty-five millimeter film gauge (width) was first 
                     developed in 1893 and is still in use today. Films produced
                     before the 1950s may use flammable cellulose nitrate as
                     their plastic base and should be treated and stored with
                     great care. Motion picture films produced after the 1950s
                     may use cellulose acetate or polyester as their base.
                     Cellulose acetate has a characteristic kind of breakdown
                     known colloquially as "vinegar syndrome." Polyester is a
                     very stable plastic; if stored properly, films with this
                     base can have very long viable lives.

                        Prone to the Following Problems
                     </span>
                     Motion picture film is prone to the following problems:
                     nitrate breakdown (if cellulose nitrate is the base),
                     acetate breakdown/vinegar syndrome (if cellulose acetate
                     is the base), mold, physical damage such as torn sprocket
                     holes, damaged splices, scratches, and mag stock breakdown.

                        Risk Level Inherent in Format
                     </span>
                     In the case of cellulose nitrate-based films, the 
                     preservation risk level is very high. Because of motion
                     picture film's impending obsolescence, any other film base
                     should be considered at moderate risk (NFPF, 2004).

                        Issues Related to Playback
                     </span>
                     Each audiovisual medium requires equipment to decode the
                     information held within it. Film is unique compared to
                     other AV media in that the information can be seen with the
                     naked eye; one can see the images printed on the film
                     without an intermediary machine. However, in order to view
                     the film as intended, a means of projection is required.
                     The National Film Preservation Foundation's (NFPF) guide
                     (2004) states that "for each film gauge there is a family
                     of like-gauged equipment and supplies designed to work
                     together. Manufacturers make the film stock with holes
                     (known as perforations), usually along the edges, to
                     advance the film strip through the sprockets of same-gauged
                     cameras and projectors" (p.6). Stated simply, you must have
                     a projector which corresponds to the film gauge you have in
                     order to play it back.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Film incurs the most physical wear through playback,
                     typically at the beginning and end of the film. Films can
                     become stuck in the projector or misalign with the take-up
                     sprockets, causing sprocket holes to tear and other serious
                     damage. For film in poor condition, projecting a film can
                     pose a significant risk, since "projectors will inflict
                     additional damage to films already weakened by shrinkage,
                     tears, or decay" (NFPF, 2004, p.20). We highly recommend
                     having a skilled technician perform a thorough inspection
                     of the film and playback equipment prior to projecting the
                     film.

                     colloquially as "vinegar syndrome."

                        Issues Related to Playback

                     Each audiovisual medium requires equipment to decode the 
                     information held within it. Film is unique compared to
                     other AV media in that the information can be seen with the
                     naked eye; one can see the images printed on the film
                     without an intermediary machine. However, in order to view
                     the film as intended, a means of projection is required.
                     The National Film Preservation Foundation's (NFPF) guide
                     (2004) states that "for each film gauge there is a family
                     of like-gauged equipment and supplies designed to work
                     together. Manufacturers make the film stock with holes
                     (known as perforations), usually along the edges, to
                     advance the film strip through the sprockets of same-gauged
                     cameras and projectors" (p.6). Stated simply, you must have
                     a projector which corresponds to the film gauge you have in
                     order to play it back.

                     Film incurs the most physical wear through playback,
                     typically at the beginning and end of the film. Films can
                     become stuck in the projector or misalign with the take-up
                     sprockets, causing sprocket holes to tear and other serious
                     damage. For film in poor condition, projecting a film can
                     pose a significant risk, since "projectors will inflict
                     additional damage to films already weakened by shrinkage,
                     tears, or decay" (NFPF, 2004, p.20). We highly recommend
                     having a skilled technician perform a thorough inspection
                     of the film and playback equipment prior to projecting the

                     The Super 8mm film gauge was first developed by Kodak in
                     the mid 1960s and is still in use today. This film format
                     can be distinguished from Regular 8mm film by its larger
                     image area and smaller sprocket holes. Super 8mm film is
                     found only with acetate or polyester plastic bases.
                     Cellulose acetate has a characteristic kind of breakdown
                     known colloquially as "vinegar syndrome." Polyester is a
                     very stable plastic, and if stored properly, films with
                     this base can have very long viable lives.

                     strip; the strip may also contain a magnetic soundtrack
                     running down one side. The width (or "gauge") of this film
                     format is 8mm. It is a format commonly found in libraries,
                     archives, museums, and especially home movie collections.

                        History
                     </span>
                     The 8mm film gauge, often called Regular 8mm to distinguish
                     it from Super 8mm, was first developed by Kodak in 1932.
                     This film format can be distinguished from Super 8mm by its
                     smaller image area and larger sprocket holes. Regular 8mm
                     film is found only with an acetate plastic base. Cellulose
                     acetate has a characteristic kind of breakdown known
                     colloquially as "vinegar syndrome."

                     Regular 8mm film is prone to the following problems:
                     acetate breakdown/vinegar syndrome (if cellulose acetate is
                     the base), mold, physical damage such as torn sprocket
                     holes, damaged splices, scratches, and mag stock breakdown.

                     Because of this motion picture film's obsolescence, this

                        Issues Related to Playback
                     </span>
                     Each audiovisual medium requires equipment to decode the
                     information held within it. Film is unique compared to
                     other AV media in that the information can be seen with the
                     naked eye; one can see the images printed on the film
                     without an intermediary machine. However, in order to view
                     the film as intended, a means of projection is required.
                     The National Film Preservation Foundation's (NFPF) guide
                     (2004) states that "for each film gauge there is a family
                     of like-gauged equipment and supplies designed to work
                     together. Manufacturers make the film stock with holes
                     (known as perforations), usually along the edges, to
                     advance the film strip through the sprockets of same-gauged
                     cameras and projectors" (p.6). Stated simply, you must have
                     a projector which corresponds to the film gauge you have in
                     order to play it back.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Film incurs the most physical wear through playback,
                     typically at the beginning and end of the film. Films can
                     become stuck in the projector or misalign with the take-up
                     sprockets, causing sprocket holes to tear and other serious
                     damage. For film in poor condition, projecting a film can
                     pose a significant risk, since "projectors will inflict
                     additional damage to films already weakened by shrinkage,
                     tears, or decay" (NFPF, 2004, p.20). We highly recommend
                     having a skilled technician perform a thorough inspection
                     of the film and playback equipment prior to projecting the
                     film.

                        The easiest way to differentiate acetate base film from

                        through the film pack, the film is polyester. If it
                        appears to be fairly opaque, the film is acetate. (Note

                     Film Composition:
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                     Film is composed of two layers&mdash;the emulsion layer,
                     which supports the photosensitive material and the thicker
                     transparent plastic base, which supports the emulsion
                     layer. The base is generally composed of one of three types
                     of plastic: nitrate, acetate or polyester. Bases may be
                     identified based on a few factors. Date can be an important
                     indicator as can film gauge. Of the three materials,
                     nitrate is the oldest, most volatile and requires the most
                     care in handling. A form of acetate film was introduced in
                     1909. It was developed to circumvent the danger of nitrate,
                     but is subject to its own particular kind of decay.

                  </h3>
                  <p>
                     Most 35mm film bases prior to the early 1950s are composed
                     of cellulose nitrate (nitrate). Nitrate is a highly
                     flammable material, with nitrate fires being nearly
                     impossible to extinguish one they've started. It can
                     ignite at relatively low temperatures&mdash;ranging from 300F
                     to 105F in later stages of decay. In the 1920s, Kodak began
                     labeling nitrate film by printing &quot;NITRATE&quot; on
                     the edge of the film.

                     Acetate, in various chemical forms ranging from cellulose
                     diacetate in 1909 to cellulose triacetate in the 1940s,
                     was an improvement over nitrate in that flammability was
                     greatly reduced. Hence, acetate films became to be known as
                     &quot;safety film&quot;. Manufacturers identified their
                     film as safety by labeling it as such. The text
                     &quot;SAFETY&quot; is often printed edge of early acetate
                     film.

                     An additional way to identify acetate is to place the film 
                     pack parallel to a light source. If light CANNOT be seen
                     piping through the film strands, it is most likely an
                     acetate-base film. The film will appear opaque and light
                     will not filter through the film pack. Acetate film can be
                     found in a variety of gauges: 35mm, 28mm, 16mm, 9.5mm,
                     Regular 8mm, and Super 8mm.

                     Polyester is the most recently developed film base. It was
                     developed in the mid-1950s, and continues to be the
                     standard for film-to-film archival preservation because of
                     its durability. It cannot be easily torn, and is chemically
                     very stable. You can identify a polyester film base by
                     piping light upwards through, and parallel to a
                     horizontally-oriented film pack. If the pack appears to
                     &quot;pipe&quot; light; that is, light can be seen through
                     the film pack, the film is polyester-based.
