                     Wax cylinder is an analog recording sound format
                     that consists of a mechanical grooved cylinder
                     made of soft wax. The earliest wax cylinders are
                     ivory or cream colored, while subsequent wax
                     cylinders are a warm medium brown color. The
                     "standard" cylinder dimensions are typically
                     2.1875" x 4.25," although they vary widely,
                     ranging from 1 5/16" diameter x 4" length, 2 1/4"
                     diameter x 8" length, 3 3/4" diameter by 6"
                     length, and 5" diameter x 4" length (Stauderman,
                     2003).</p>

                  <p><span class="bold"> History </span>
                     Cylinders are the earliest manufactured recorded
                     sound format. They were developed by Thomas Edison
                     in 1877 and remained in commercial production
                     until 1929. Cylinder recording technology was
                     still used from the 1930s until the early 1960s
                     for ethnographic field recording notes and office
                     dictation.</p>

                     All grooved disc media is susceptible to warpage,
                     breakage, groove wear, and surface contamination
                     (Farrington,1991). Surface contamination includes
                     dirt, dust, mold, and other foreign
                     materials&mdash;all of which can abrade or damage
                     the grooves and diminish playback sound quality.
                     Wax cylinders are especially prone to issues
                     related to humid storage environments, namely
                     fungal growth. Additionally, materials within the
                     wax cylinder harden with age, causing the wax to
                     become brittle. The surface of wax cylinders is
                     soft and fragile, and they are also prone to
                     surface scratching and groove wear.</p>

                  <!-- Risk Level Section -->
                  <p><span class="bold">Risk Level Inherent in Format</span>
                     Because of the age, fragility, obsolescence, and
                     relative uniqueness of the content, cylinders
                     should be given priority for reformatting.</p>

                  <!-- Issues Related to Playback Section -->
                  <p><span class="bold">Issues Related to Playback</span>
                     All audiovisual media require equipment to decode
                     the information held within it. Cylinders of
                     different diameters cannot be played on the same
                     machine (Stauderman, 2003); attempting to do so
                     will damage the cylinder. The earliest wax
                     cylinders are typically 2 to 2.5 minutes in length
                     with 100 grooves per inch. Playback speed is also
                     a consideration, since cylinders have different
                     rotation speeds depending on the manufacturer and
                     technology. Rotation speeds include 120 rpm, 144
                     rpm, and 160 rpm (Stauderman, 2003).
