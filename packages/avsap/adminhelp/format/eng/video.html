                        Description:
                     </span>
                     Umatic is a magnetic tape-based moving image format. The
                     tape is composed of magnetic particles, a binder, and a
                     polyester base (Forgas, 1997). Full-size cassettes are 8
                     5/8" x 5 3/8" x 1 3/16" and small cassettes are 7 1/4" x 4
                     5/8" x 1 3/16" (Texas Commission on the Arts, 2004). The
                     full-sized cassettes can record up to 60 minutes of content
                     whereas the smaller cassettes hold up to 20 minutes. The
                     picture quality of SP is superior to standard Umatic;
                     however, although the SP tapes can be played back in a
                     standard deck, the improvement in picture quality is lost.
                     Standard Umatic tapes cannot be played back on a SP deck.

                        History
                     </span>
                     Standard Umatic was introduced in 1971 and SP was
                     introduced in 1986. The format was primarily developed for
                     industrial and education markets. In the 1970s and 1980s,
                     it was widely used for electronic news gathering, and up
                     through the 1990s, it was a primary format for many
                     artists, community activists, academic institutions, and
                     production houses. Many artist and community videos are in
                     this format; it was a preferred format for edit masters in
                     the 1980s (Texas Commission on the Arts, 2004).

                     Older tapes are susceptible to signal loss, while more
                     recent tapes tend to fair a bit better. However, the
                     biggest concern is media and hardware obsolescence (Texas
                     Commission on the Arts, 2004). Tapes are also susceptible
                     to damage from mold, binder deterioration, and other
                     physical and biological issues.

                     Betacam and Betacam SP is a magnetic tape-based moving
                     image format. The tape is composed of magnetic particles,
                     a binder, and a polyester base (Forgas, 1997). Large
                     cassette cases are 10 5/8" x 6 3/8" x 1 1/4". Small
                     cassette cases are 6 3/4" x 4 3/8" x 1 3/16". Tape
                     cassettes are generally labeled (as "Betacam" or
                     "BetacamSP") in the upper right-hand corner (Texas

                     Betacam was introduced in 1982 and BetacamSP was introduced
                     in 1986. BetacamSP has techincal advantages over Betacam
                     and is "upwardly compatible"; that is, Betacam tapes are
                     playable on BetacamSP decks, but tapes recorded in
                     BetacamSP ARE NOT playable on Betacam decks. Decks for
                     Betacam are no longer being manufactured, while BetacamSP
                     decks are still in production in limited supply. Most newer
                     decks in the Betacam family, such as Digital Betacam decks,
                     will play BetacamSP tapes (Texas Commission on the Arts,
                     2004).

                     Older Betacam tapes are susceptible to signal loss due to
                     age. Tapes are also susceptible to damage from mold, binder
                     deterioration, and other physical and biological issues.
                     Equipment obsolescence is not yet a concern as BetacamSP
                     and Digital Betacam decks are still in production and can
                     play back a variety of Beta cassettes.

                     Betamax was introduced in 1975 and was in use until the

                     ultimately lost the format war to VHS. It was developed for
                     the consumer, industrial, and educational markets. Although
                     it did not gain widespread consumer popularity, this format
                     was considered to be technically superior to VHS and was
                     used extensively in schools, community media centers, and

                     D3 is a magnetic tape-based moving image format. The tape
                     is composed of magnetic particles, a binder, and a
                     polyester base (Forgas, 1997). Cassettes are 8 1/4" x 4
                     7/8" x 15/16" with a tape width of 1/2" (Texas Commission
                     on the Arts, 2004). The cassettes are usually gray with
                     tape identification in the upper right-hand corner.

                     D3 was introduced in 1990 and is presently still in use. It
                     was developed for high-end production, has longer tape
                     times and less cost per tape compared to D2, and has been
                     used as a mastering format in television, advertising, and
                     corporate sectors (Texas Commission on the Arts, 2004).

                     Physically, D3 is subject to the same concerns as analog
                     tape&mdash;stretching, breaking, drop-outs, mold, binder
                     deterioration, and unintended recording. It is
                     unpredictable how long D3 will remain on the market
                     considering the "format wars" among digital tape and
                     playback equipment manufacturers (Texas Commission on the
                     Arts, 2004).

                     As with most magnetic media, D3 is subject to the threat of
                     obsolescence. It is difficult to determine how long this
                     format will continue to be supported. It is not recommended
                     as an archival format. Considering its age and comparative
                     durability, reformatting is not an immediate preservation
                     priority (unless there are obvious signs of tape failure).

                     As with most magnetic media, DVCam is subject to the threat
                     of obsolescence; however, its present market share suggests
                     that this threat is low. Although DVCam is not an archival
                     format, reformatting is not an immediate preservation

                     DVCPro is a magnetic tape-based moving image format. The
                     tape is composed of magnetic particles, a binder, and a
                     polyester base (Forgas, 1997). Large cassettes measure 4
                     7/8" x 3" x 9/16", are for use in recording and editing
                     decks, and have an available recording length of about 126
                     minutes. Medium cassettes measure 3 13/16" x 2 1/2" x
                     9/16," are for use in cameras, and have an available
                     recording length of up to 66 minutes. Cassettes are
                     generally dark gray in color with a yellow anti-static
                     cover (Panasonic), black with a yellow anti-static cover
                     (Maxell), or black with a red anti-static cover (Fuji). The
                     DVCPro logo is usually in the upper right-hand corner, and
                     the tape length is generally listed on the left-hand
                     corner. Panasonic cassettes also designate large cassettes
                     with the letter "L" after the tape length (i.e. 126L)
                     (Texas Commission on the Arts, 2004).

                     DVCPro was introduced in 1995, and is presently still in
                     use. The DVCPro format was developed by Panasonic for
                     industrial, educational, and professional markets. It is
                     used for electronic news gathering, cable television, and
                     other field production, including independent production.
                     One of the first small digital formats, it was initially
                     popular, but more recently has lost ground to other DV
                     products (Texas Commission on the Arts, 2004).

                     DVCPro is subject to the same physical issues as analog
                     tape&mdash;stretching, breaking, drop-outs, mold, binder
                     deterioration, and unintended recording. The DVCPro format
                     uses the same tape width and compression rate as DVCAM, but
                     the cassette housing is different and it is not fully
                     compatible with other digital video (DV) products. DVCPro
                     decks will play MiniDV and DVCAM tapes; however, few DVCAM
                     decks will play DVCPro tapes. Considering these "format
                     wars," the future of DVCPro is unknown (Texas Commission on
                     the Arts, 2004).

                     MiniDV was introduced in 1995, and is presently still in

                     commonly known as MiniDV. It was developed for consumer,
                     industrial, and educational markets. MiniDV is used
                     extensively by artists and community activists, both in the
                     educational sector and in independent production. Its small
                     size and high visual quality make it popular for field
                     acquisition (camera recording) (Texas Commission on the

                     However, as with any newer video format, it is difficult to
                     predict how long it will be supported. The size and
                     durability of MiniDV, as with any small, thin tape, is a
                     concern. It has similar issues as Hi8 (Texas Commission on

                     VHS and S-VHS. A VHS (or SVHS) logo is usually imprinted
                     on the cassette in the upper right-hand corner, while the
                     manufacturer's name is imprinted in the upper left. S-VHS
                     tapes have an additional hole on the back of the cassette
                     (Texas Commission on the Arts, 2004).

                     VHS was introduced in 1976 and S-VHS was introduced in
                     1987. S-VHS has a superior picture quality compared to VHS
                     and is "upwardly compatible"; that is, S-VHS tapes are
                     playable in VHS decks but VHS tapes ARE NOT playable in
                     S-VHS decks. The VHS format is currently still in use,
                     although it is fading quickly due to newer, more popular
                     digital formats. S-VHS was largely replaced by digital
                     video by the 1990s.

                     Video8 and Hi8 are magnetic tape-based moving image
                     formats. The tape is composed of magnetic particles, a

                     for both Video8 and Hi8 are 3 11/16" x 2 3/8" x 9/16"
                     (Texas Commission on the Arts, 2004). Tapes are usually

                     Video8 was introduced in 1984 and Hi8 came soon after in
                     1989. Video8 was developed for the consumer market, whereas
                     Hi8 was geared toward consumer, industrial, and educational
                     markets (Texas Commission on the Arts, 2004). Decks for
                     both formats are still in use and are still being produced
                     and marketed. However, digital formats may cause these
                     formats to become obsolete. Hi8 has technical advantages
                     over Video8 and is "upwardly compatible"; that is, Hi8
                     tapes are playable on Video8 decks, but tapes recorded in
                     Video8 ARE NOT playable on Hi8 decks (Texas Commission on
                     the Arts, 2004).

                     Both Video8 and Hi8 tapes are prone to stretching. The
                     longer the tape (longer than 60 minutes), the more
                     susceptible it is to damage. Metal evaporated (ME) tapes
                     are especially likely to have durability problems. Digital
                     formats are replacing Video8 and Hi8, so near future
                     obsolescence is a risk. Due to their size, Video8 and Hi8
                     decks are not as durable as their larger format
                     counterparts and are difficult and expensive to repair.
                     These factors could affect future availability of playback
                     equipment. However, Digital8 decks may offer a playback
                     solution.

                     Although these formats are relatively new, they are
                     especially fragile and are not recommended for long-term
                     storage. ME tapes are especially prone to durability
                     problems. Depending on the intellectual content, it is
                     recommended that these formats receive reformatting

                     Two inch open reel (or "quad") is a magnetic tape-based
                     moving image format. The tape is composed of magnetic
                     particles, a binder, and a polyester base (Forgas, 1997).
                     The reel is approximately 12" inches in diameter. The
                     shipping container for this format is easily identifiable
                     due to its sheer size, at 15" square x 4", weighing up to
                     20-30 lbs. Two inch open reels may also be found in
                     cardboard boxes (Texas Commission on the Arts, 2004). The
                     containers often hold extensive labeling information.

                     Two inch quad was introduced in 1956 and was continued to
                     be used until the early 1980s. It was the first video

                     Two inch quad is especially susceptible to risks associated
                     with age, hardware, and equipment obsolescence. It is also
                     prone to risks common to other types of magnetic media,
                     such as mold, binder deterioration, physical damage, and
                     signal drop-outs. The tape's original shipping container
                     can also pose a risk. As the spongy container liner decays,
                     it deteriorates into a powder and then a gummy substance
                     that is difficult to clean off of the tape.

                     Two inch quad tapes should be reformatted by a vendor with
                     proven experience with this format. As this format is long

                     One inch open reel is a magnetic tape-based moving image
                     format. The tape is composed of magnetic particles, a
                     binder, and a polyester base (Forgas, 1997). Common
                     containers are made from plastic or sometimes cardboard;
                     they are rectangular or have one curved side with a handle.
                     The containers typically have large labels with program
                     titles, show air dates, record dates, and/or other
                     information related to broadcast television (Texas
                     Commission on the Arts, 2004). One inch open reels are
                     easily identified by their distinctive wide hub. Audio
                     recordings made on 1" tape may be mistaken for videotape.

                     One inch open reel was introduced in 1978 and was used
                     until approximately the mid 1990s, primarily for in-studio
                     recordings. It was also used for preservation masters
                     beginning in the late 1980s and early 1990s (Texas
                     Commission on the Arts, 2004).

                     Half inch open reel is a magnetic tape-based moving image
                     format. The tape is composed of magnetic particles, a
                     binder, and a polyester base (Forgas, 1997). The most
                     common containers for smaller tapes are approximately 5
                     1/2" x 5 1/2" x 1" in size and are made of a soft or hard
                     plastic. Larger reels will be in containers approximately
                     8 3/8" x 8 3/8" x 1 1/4" in size. The plastic container may
                     also be inside of a separate paperboard sleeve. There are
                     other containers that are approximately the same size but
                     have handles. Commonly used reels are 5" in diameter or 7
                     1/4" in diameter (Texas Commission on the Arts, 2004).

                     Developed for the industrial, educational, and consumer
                     markets, half inch open reel was introduced in 1965 and was
                     used primarily for in-studio recording until approximately
                     the late 1970s, when it was gradually replaced by cassette
                     formats. It was also used as a format for preservation
                     masters beginning in the late 1980s and early 1990s (Texas
                     Commission on the Arts, 2004). Smaller reels were used in
                     the first portable video recorders, or "portapaks," and
                     larger reels were typically used for stationary recording
                     and/or video editing.
