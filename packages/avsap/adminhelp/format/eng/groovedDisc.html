                     Shellac-type is a coarse grooved-disc recorded sound format
                     made up of varying components, but typically include clay
                     (Byritis), powdered shellac, lampblack, cotton fibers
                     (originally known as Durinoid), and may contain other
                     resins, plasticizers, hardeners, and fillers (Stauderman,
                     2003). Shellac discs are most commonly one of the following
                     sizes: 7 inch, 10 inch, 12 inch, and 16 inch. They are
                     typically played back at the following speeds: 70 rpm, 78
                     rpm, and 30 rpm (Stauderman, 2003).</p>

                     The earliest discs are made of a shellac-type material, and
                     were available from 1897 to the late 1940s.</p>

                     All grooved disc media is susceptible to warpage, breakage,
                     groove wear, and surface contamination (Farrington,1991).
                     Surface contamination includes dirt, dust, mold, and other
                     foreign materials&mdash;all of which can abrade or damage
                     the grooves and diminish playback sound quality. Excessive
                     surface damage and groove wear are generally identifiable
                     on discs which have a dull surface and scratches, pits, and
                     cracks.</p>

                     Shellac-type 78s manufactured post-WWI are relatively
                     stable and not considered especially vulnerable to
                     age-related deterioration or inherent vice (Paton, 1998).
                     Pre-WWI discs may be composed of more volatile materials
                     and may require greater preservation attention (IASA,
                     2003). Presently, playback equipment for this format is
                     still being manufactured.</p>

                  <p><span class="bold">Issues Related to Playback</span>
                     All grooved disc media must be played back at the
                     appropriate recording speed, require appropriate styli for
                     optimal playback fidelity and to reduce disc damage, and
                     equipment that can support the discs' diameters. Most discs
                     recorded before 1948 have wider grooves (often referred to
                     as "coarse" or "standard" grooves), were recorded using
                     equalizations that differ from current standards, and are
                     generally monaural (Paton, 1998). A stylus which can
                     support coarse groove and monaural recordings is necessary
                     for proper playback.

                  <p>
                     Often, early 78s were not cut at exactly 78 rotations per
                     minute (rpm), so correct speed may not be standardized from
                     one disc to the next. Additionally, groove size varies, so
                     a variety of different styli are necessary to ensure that
                     you are not using too small or too wide of a stylus, which
                     can adversely affect playback quality and/or irreparably
                     damage the disc.

                     Laminate-type is a grooved disc recorded sound format
                     composed of cellulose nitrate or acetate cellulose lacquer
                     on an aluminum, glass, or zinc core (Stauderman, 2003). The
                     most common sizes include: 10 inch, 12 inch, 13 inch, or 16
                     inch; although atypical, smaller and larger disc sizes can

                     Laminate-type discs were in use predominantly in the 1930s
                     to 1940s, until magnetic tape became widely adopted. They

                     Surface contamination includes dirt, dust, mold, and other

                     on discs which have a dull surface and scratches, pits, and
                     cracks. Laminate-type discs are prone to unpredictable and
                     sudden catastrophic failure due to surface delamination;
                     the lacquer coating can contract on the core, often due to
                     being stored in an environment with high humidity and/or
                     temperature. It can crack or peel away from the core,
                     causing information loss. Additionally, laminate discs may
                     suffer from plasticizer loss, which causes the disc coating
                     to become brittle and can lead to delamination. Plasticizer
                     loss, or exudiation, is identifiable as a white, greasy
                     powder with a crystalline appearance that appears on the
                     disc's surface. It is often mistaken for mold, but is in
                     fact the fatty acids (palmetic or searic) which migrate to
                     the disc's surface as the plasticizers begin to
                     deteriorate.</p>

                     Laminate-type discs are prone to unpredictable and sudden
                     catastrophic failure due to surface delamination; the

                     temperature, and can crack, causing information loss.
                     Additionally, laminate discs often contain unique and
                     original material, since content is captured and inscribed
                     to the disc immediately. These discs are not created
                     through a molding process like most other types of grooved
                     discs. Instead, the discs are "direct-cut": the same discs
                     are used for both the recording and the replay without the
                     need for galvanoplastic processing and pressing (Paton,
                     1998). Since these discs are prone to sudden failure and
                     signal loss and often hold unique content, they are
                     considered a high priority for preservation reformatting.</p>

                     discs may also play from the inside out; the starting

                     most LP records are played. Most discs recorded before

                     differ from current standards, and are generally monaural

                     its relatively soft material. If stored in an ideal
                     environment (relatively low and stable temperature and
                     humidity), vinyl discs are stable. However, high humidity
                     and temperatures can adversely affect these discs by
                     creating prime conditions for fungal growth. High
                     temperatures may also cause the plastics to soften and
                     warp, reducing the disc's sound quality or playability.
                     Additionally, direct sunlight and UV rays can adversely
                     affect the soft vinyl material.

                     Discs can be damaged by attendant materials such as acidic
                     cardboard sleeves and non-archival inner plastic or paper
                     sleeves, although some plastic sleeves may be acceptable
                     for archival storage. As a rule of thumb, "bad" sleeves are
                     clear and have a sticky or tacky feel; "good" sleeves are
                     frosted in appearance and have a slippery feel (Library of
                     Congress, 2002). Non-archival sleeves should be replaced
                     with high density polyethylene sleeves. If the original
                     paper sleeve contains graphics or artwork that are of
                     archival value, some archival sleeves may be thin enough
                     to fit inside the original. In order to prevent migration
                     of materials to the disc's surface, "many archivists choose
                     to store microgroove discs in neutral plastic inner liners
                     made of high pressure polyethylene contained in neutral
                     envelopes, with acidic original covers stored separately"
                     (Warren, 1993).</p>

                     Vinyl-type 45s and LPs are not presently considered
                     especially vulnerable to age-related deterioration or
                     inherent vice (Paton, 1998). They are generally chemically
                     stable and have a relatively long lifespan when stored
                     properly. Playback equipment is still being manufactured.
                     Therefore, discs of this type are generally a low
                     preservation priority.</p>

                  <!-- Issues Related to Playback Section -->
                  <p><span class="bold">Issues Related to Playback</span>
                     All grooved disc media must be played back at the
                     appropriate recording speed, require appropriate styli for
                     optimal playback fidelity and to reduce disc damage, and
                     equipment that can support the discs' diameters. Most discs
                     of this type are microgroove; they have nearly twice the
                     number of grooves as a coarse groove disc. Often times,
                     these discs are stereo with standard equalization. However,
                     "it is not wise to assume either that all postrecordings
                     are microgroove, or that all recordings made after 1955 are
                     stereo with RlAA equalization. Only examination of the
                     discs and supporting documentation will clarify groove
                     type" (Paton, 1998). Using too large of a stylus and too
                     heavy weight tracking can gouge out the grooves on the
                     disc, irreparably damaging the disc and preventing future
                     playback./p>

               <p>Grooved discs are generally composed of either shellac, a
                  fiber, glass or aluminum core coated with a laminate, or vinyl.</p>
               <p>Grooved discs materials At-A-Glance: (scroll down for more
                  information and images)</p>
               <p></p><h4 class="h3">Laminate discs:</h4>
               <ul>
                  <li>Laminate discs are discs composed of some type of plastic
                     or resin  surrounding a core. </li>
                  <li>The core can be one of many types of material  including
                     cardboard, aluminum and glass. Glass discs are most fragile
                     of all laminate discs</li>
                  <li>Often have a handwritten or non-commercially printed
                     label</li>
                  <li>If you look into the spindle holes at an angle and you
                     see a glint of metallic or brownish, paper-like material
                     (or any  material with otherwise appears different than
                     the surface of the  disc), it is most likely a laminate</li>
                  <li>>Typically contain more than one spindle hole. Extra holes
                     may be  obscured by the label. You can determine if there
                     are additional holes  by shining a light source upward from
                     beneath the disc. If there are  additional holes, the light
                     should be slightly visible as it is just  passing though
                     the label layers.</li>
                  <li>May have surface peeling. If the surface of the disc is
                     peeling  (delaminating), and you see a material different
                     than the surface  material the disc is a laminate. Also, if
                     the surface is peeling, the  disc is beginning to fail.</li>
                  <li>Depending upon the core material, laminate discs are often
                     heavier than vinyl and lighter than shellac.</li>
                  <li>Are often less flexible than a vinyl disc
                  </li><li>Occur in a variety of sizes ranging from as large as
                     20&quot; and 16&quot; to 7&quot;</li>
                  <li>Radio transcription discs are often 16&quot; laminate discs
                     <p><strong>How to determine if the core is glass:<br />
                        </strong>Shine some type of light source upwards from
                        beneath the disc, or,  ideally set the disc on light
                        table. If the disc appears translucent  (you can see the
                        light through the disc) it is most likely glass.</p>
                  </li></ul>
               <strong>Glass core discs:</strong>
               <ul>
                  <li>ARE EXTREMELY FRAGILE. Can easily break, or crack beneath
                     the laminate surface</li>
                  <li>If GENTLY tapped, sound slightly different than aluminum
                     discs.  WARNING: if you use this method, tap EXTREMELY
                     gently as the glass may  already be damaged.</li>
                  <li>Are semi-translucent when light is projected through
                     them</li>
                  <li>Are slightly heavier compared to an aluminum-based
                     disc</li>
                  <li>Do not warp like fiber-based (cardboard) or aluminum-based
                     laminate discs</li>
                  <li>Most often are found in discs that were recorded between
                     1941 and 1945</li>
               </ul>

               <p></p><h4 class="h3">Shellac discs:</h4>
               <ul>
                  <li>Are the oldest type of grooved disc; a disc manufactured
                     prior to the late 1920s is most likely shellac</li>
                  <li>Are commercial recordings, and should have
                     commercially produced center labels</li>
                  <li>Are typically heavier than vinyl or laminates,
                     especially if the disc is thick</li>
                  <li>Tend to be thicker than vinyl or laminates; although
                     a notable  exception is the wood-pulp core, and laminated
                     Edison Diamond disc  which is approximately 1/4&quot;
                     thick!</li>
                  <li>Tend to be very hard compared to vinyl or laminates (are
                     not as flexible as the other two disc types)</li>
                  <li>Tend to have a dull surface compared to a well-preserved
                     vinyl or laminate discs</li>
                  <li>Are prone to shattering when dropped or bent</li>
               </ul>
               <h4 class="h3">Vinyl discs:</h4>
               <ul>
                  <li>Are the most recent disc composition and is still
                     presently in use
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     Are typically commercially produced, and will have a
                     commercially printed label
                  </li>
                  <li>Are generally much thinner, and more flexible than
                     laminates or shellacs
                  </li>
               </ul>
               <p><strong>Shellac:</strong></p>
               <p>Shellac discs are primarily composed of clay (Byritis),
                  powdered  shellac, lampblack, cotton fibers (originally known
                  as Durinoid), and  may contain other resins, plasticizers,
                  hardeners, and fillers  (Stauderman, 2003). Most shellac discs
                  are solid throughout; the core  is generally not composed of a
                  separate material. There are some  instances, however, when a
                  shellac disc may have a cardboard core.  These discs tend to
                  be very hard, become brittle with age, are prone to
                  shattering if dropped, and are susceptible to damage by mold
                  and acidic  substances (Warren,1994).</p>
               <p>Shellac discs may not scratch as easily as vinyl and are
                  generally  stable if they have been stored in dry conditions.
                  When examining these  discs, you may notice signs of surface
                  damage such as dirt, dust, mold,  scratches, groove wear (the
                  disc appears dull and the surface may have a whitish
                  appearance), and brittleness. Be especially aware that shellac
                  laminate discs (discs with a core made of cardboard or other
                  material that is coated with shellac) can be more fragile. You
                  may be  able to assess if the disc is a laminate if you gently
                  lift the record,  tilt it slightly so that you can see into
                  the center spindle hole, and  look for any indication that the
                  shellac is not solid. For example, you  may actually see
                  cardboard by looking through the spindle hole. When  cleaning
                  shellac discs, DO NOT use fluids that contain alcohol as it
                  can dissolve the shellac (Gibson, 1987).</p>

               <p><strong>Laminate (a.ka. Lacquer/instantaneous/&quot;acetate&quot;/direct cut</strong>):</p>
               <p>Laminatediscs can be made of aluminum or cellulose nitrate on a  core.
                  The core can be made of a number of varying materials, including
                  glass, aluminum, and cardboard. These discs are susceptible to surface
                  and core deterioration. The surface coating is prone to shrinking away
                  from the core and to plasticizer loss, which appears as a whitish,
                  mold-like contamination on the surface. Glass cores can easily break if
                  not handled gently. Additionally, the core, depending on the material,
                  is especially susceptible to damage from humidity. When assessing the
                  condition of the disc, observe if there is any coating flaking off of
                  the core. The coating holds the information content and grooves; it is
                  therefore especially important to note any loss of the surface coating.
                  Also look for a whitish powder on the surface. This could be mold,
                  plasticizer loss, or other residue. The best way to determine if the
                  contamination is mold is to observe the surface under a microscope.
                  If  the contaminant looks fuzzy or lattice-like, it is most likely mold;
                  other substances may have a more crystalline appearance. Laminate
                  discs are often of high priority for reformatting due to their
                  fragility. As Laminatediscs are direct-cut discs (that is, the
                  content is etched directly into the disc at the time of recording)
                  they are often unique and the content may not be found elsewhere.</p>

               <p><strong>Vinyl/Plastic: </strong></p>
               <p>Compared to shellac and other grooved disc materials, plastic is
                  relatively soft. It is more susceptible to surface damage from
                  abrasion, resulting in scratches and pits that affect the quality of
                  playback. It is also especially susceptible to damage through contact
                  with acidic substances, uneven pressures, hard materials, and high
                  temperatures (Warren, 1994). Humidity levels and age can also affect
                  the plastic; dry conditions and natural aging can cause embrittlement.
                  Recordings with a dull surface, scratches, and pits may have been
                  damaged through heavy use.</p>
