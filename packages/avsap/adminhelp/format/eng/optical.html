                  <p><span class="bold">Description: </span> DVD is a digital
                     optical disc format which can hold moving image or recorded
                     sound material. DVDs (Digital Versatile Disc or Digital
                     Video Disc) are the same dimensions as CDs: 120 mm in
                     diameter and 1.2 mm thick. DVDs, however, are made up of
                     two discs of 0.6mm thickness, which are bonded together
                     (Bradley, 2006). A disc may hold content on a single side
                     or on both sides. The amount of content stored on the disc
                     depends on how the content is compressed; if the data is
                     heavily compressed, more data will fit on the disc. Some
                     discs are recordable (DVD-/+R) and some discs can be
                     written, erased, and recorded multiple times (DVD-RW).</p>
                  <p><span class="bold"> History </span> DVDs were introduced to
                     the marketplace in 1996-1997. It has since supplanted
                     videocassette and is presently the industry leader for
                     consumer movie releases.</p>
                  <p><span class="bold">Prone to the Following Problems</span>
                     Most DVD damage is incurred through poor storage and
                     handling. Surface scratches, gouges, and smudges can
                     inhibit playback of the disc. There may be some inherent
                     vice within the materials used to create DVDs, but signal
                     loss due to inherent vice is not as frequent in newer DVDs.
                     Scratches on the label side of commercially produced DVDs
                     are less damaging than they are to CDs, as DVDs have an
                     extra layer of polycarbonate that protects the metallic
                     recording layer within the disc. All optical media should
                     be stored in cool, dry, and dark conditions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Data on DVDs, especially non-replicated, recordable/rewritable
                     DVDs, is subject to loss over time. All optical media
                     should be regularly checked for data degradation.

                     &quot;relies on the interaction of the individual burner,
                     the medium, and the individual player&quot; (Bradley, 2006,
                     p. ii). Discs recorded at higher speeds tend to use less
                     dye when encoding the signal, which is &quot;a contributing
                     factor in the long term failure of recordable optical
                     media&quot; (p. 9). </p>
                  <p><span class="bold">Risk Level Inherent in Format</span>
                     Playback equipment and media are still readily available
                     for this format. Recordable discs, especially those
                     recorded at high speeds, may have significantly shorter
                     life spans than other discs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Optical media should not be considered an archival format
                     due to the high cost of maintenance and error-checking.
                     Recordable discs may be appropriate as a temporary solution
                     for small oral history archives that hold a small
                     collection of compact cassettes that are in need of
                     immediate reformatting, and who are under funding
                     restraints (ARSC Technical Committee, 2009). However,
                     transfer to optical media should not be considered the
                     final stage for this type of archival preservation.</p>
                  <p><span class="bold">Issues Related to Playback</span>
                     Commercial DVDs may contain region code information. Discs
                     with this encoded information require playback equipment
                     that corresponds to the discs' region code.
                     Recordable/rewritable DVDs can be recorded at varying
                     speeds. Since the recording speed of more recent players
                     has increased, older DVD players may not be able to handle
                     discs recorded at higher speeds. If you encounter an issue
                     playing back a DVD in one machine, try playing it back in
                     another machine before concluding that the fault lies with
                     the DVD.</p>

                     Compact Disc (CD) is a digital optical disc format that can
                     hold a variety of digital material, including recorded
                     sound and moving image. Data capacity, however, prevents
                     the storage of extremely large movie files. CDs are the
                     same dimensions as DVDs: 120 mm in diameter and 1.2 mm
                     thick. Content is only stored on one side of the disc. The
                     amount of content on the disc depends on how the content is
                     compressed; if the data is heavily compressed, more data
                     will fit on the disc. Some discs are recordable (CD-/+R)
                     and some discs can be written, erased, and recorded
                     multiple times (CD-RW).</p>
                  <p><span class="bold"> History </span>
                     CDs were introduced in 1983.The format supplanted
                     audiocassettes and vinyl discs. Presently, non-physical
                     digital media (such as MP3s) have begun to edge out CDs as
                     a popular content delivery method.</p>
                  <p><span class="bold">Prone to the Following Problems</span>
                     Most CD damage is incurred through poor storage and
                     handling. Surface scratches, gouges, and smudges can
                     inhibit playback of the disc. There may be some inherent
                     vice within the materials used to create CDs, but signal
                     loss due to inherent vice is not as frequent in newer CDs.
                     If the seal encasing the aluminum recording surface is
                     somehow compromised, the aluminum layer can oxidize,
                     resulting in data loss. This deterioration is colloquially
                     referred to as "disc rot" or "laser rot." Indications of
                     disc rot include: pin-sized holes in the reflective layer,
                     a bronze coloring on the non-labeled side of the disc, and
                     crazing. Crazing can be seen in snowflake-like or
                     fractal-like milky-white patterns on the disc. Crazing
                     typically only affects early CDs because as manufacturing
                     processes improved, the issue became less of a problem.
                     Scratches on the label side of CDs can also affect
                     playback, since CDs are relatively thin and composed of a
                     single layer of reflective aluminum encased in
                     polycarbonate. Any discs that exhibit these signs of
                     deterioration should be error checked and/or replaced.

                  <p>
                     Recordable and rewritable CDs contain a dye layer that can
                     cause numerous problems such as signal loss and failure,
                     due to several factors. The quality of the recorded signal
                     "relies on the interaction of the individual burner, the
                     medium, and the individual player" (Bradley, 2006, p. ii).
                     Discs recorded at higher speeds tend to use less dye when
                     encoding the signal, which is "a contributing factor in the
                     long term failure of recordable optical media" (p. 9).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     In order to slow data loss, all optical media should be
                     stored in cool, dry, and dark conditions. </p>

                     Although all CDs look the same, there are several different
                     formats: CD+G (Compact Disc plus Graphics), CD-I (Compact
                     Disc-Interactive), CD-R (Compact Disc-Recordable) and
                     CD-RW (Compact Disc-Rewritable). These formats may require
                     specific playback equipment (e.g. CD+G), playback equipment
                     that supports delivery of both audio and video content
                     (e.g. CD-I), and/or equipment that can read discs written
                     at lower/higher spin speeds. CD-R and CD-RW, depending upon
                     when they were created and the disc writer capabilities,
                     may not be playable in all CD players or CD-Rom drives.

                     Laserdisc is an analog optical disc format. While this
                     format is read via a laser, the signal is typically
                     analog&mdash; although some audio tracks on the laserdisc
                     can be encoded digitally. Discs released before the mid-80s
                     are also known by other trademarked names such as
                     Reflective Optical Videodisc, Laser Videodisc, Laservision,
                     and MCA DiscoVision. LaserDisc is a trademarked name given
                     to a version of this optical storage format developed by
                     the Philips Corporation, but has become the common name for
                     this format. Different disc formats may require proprietary
                     equipment for playback. The discs are typically 12" in
                     diameter&mdash;the size of a standard LP vinyl disc.</p>
                  <p><span class="bold"> History </span>
                     Laserdiscs and players were commercially available in the
                     late 1970s. Although most laserdiscs were commercial
                     releases, they were also used for information dissemination
                     in industrial and educational settings.</p>
                  <p><span class="bold">Prone to the Following Problems</span>
                     Laserdiscs are subject to mechanical and surface
                     contaminants. Scratches and dirt can drastically affect
                     laser performance, as playback equipment can become
                     misaligned and mistracked. Additionally, laserdiscs do not
                     have some of the error correction technology that later
                     optical media have, and they are much more sensitive to
                     damage.</p>
                  <p>Inherent vice also affects laserdisc. Some manufacturing 
                     defects adversely affect the lifespan and playback quality
                     of the discs. Discs may succumb to surface crazing, where
                     the surface of the discs exhibits a milky white, lattice,
                     or spider web-like pattern. Crazing can indicate that the
                     seal which protects the inner aluminum signal carrier has
                     broken, making the inner core vulnerable to oxidation.
                     Oxidation is also known as laser rot, as the aluminum loses
                     its reflectivity and the quality of the playback signal
                     degrades. Oxidation of the delicate aluminum can render the
                     signal irretrievable. </p>
                  <p><span class="bold">Risk Level Inherent in Format</span>
                     Laserdiscs and players are long obsolete. Based on the 
                     value and uniqueness of the content, these discs should be
                     prioritized for preservation reformatting.</p>

                  <p><span class="bold">Issues Related to Playback</span>
                     The earliest forms of laserdisc may require proprietary
                     playback equipment, as in the case of DiscoVision discs.
                     Since laserdisc players are long obsolete and used players
                     are most likely over 20 years old, playback may be hindered
                     by mechanical failure and/or track or laser misalignment.
                     Track misalignment can degrade the quality of the playback
                     signal and can introduce "crosstalk," where signals from
                     contiguous tracks bleed into the track being played.</p>

                  <p>Laserdiscs only hold a maximum of 55 minutes of data
                     (depending on the type of disc). As such, discs may be
                     double sided. Data-rich content such as a feature-length
                     film may be recorded on several discs. During playback,
                     users must manually change discs or flip the disc over in
                     order to continue accessing the material.</p>

                     MiniDisc is a digital recorded sound format. It uses 
                     similar encoding technology as CD, although the disc is
                     enclosed in a 7cm x 7cm cartridge. There are two distinct
                     types of MiniDisc: Prerecorded, which is very similar to
                     CD in operation and manufacture, and Recordable MDs, which
                     can be recorded repeatedly and employ magneto-optical
                     technology (MiniDisc.org, n.d.).</p>

                  <p><span class="bold"> History </span>
                     MiniDiscs were introduced in the early 1990s by the Sony
                     Corporation. It was marketed as a medium for recording and
                     distributing near-CD quality consumer audio and was
                     designed to replace the analog cassette tape.</p>

                  <p><span class="bold">Prone to the Following Problems</span>
                     Information encoded on MiniDiscs is stored in a compressed
                     format. As MiniDiscs are recorded, the data stream is
                     compressed. Audio quality begins to degrade when subsequent
                     copies are made and the disc undergoes multiple
                     re-compression. Thus, copies made from MiniDiscs, even
                     digital copies, are not true clones and will be more
                     compressed than the master disc. This will affect the
                     audio quality (MiniDisc.org, n.d.). </p>

                  <p><span class="bold">Risk Level Inherent in Format</span>
                     Specific playback equipment is required to access the 
                     content. Since the information encoded on a MiniDisc is
                     compressed, and since the format is not as widely adopted
                     as other formats, it is not an archival medium. Equipment
                     obsolescence is not yet a high risk; however, the
                     compression scheme employed in recordable MiniDiscs (ATRAC)
                     is proprietary and unpublished (IASA, 2003). It is not yet
                     clear if previous generations of ATRAC recordings will be
                     retrievable in future iterations. Pre-recorded MiniDiscs
                     are relatively stable and similar to CDs, and may be a low
                     priority for transfer. However, unique content contained
                     on a recordable MiniDisc should be considered a high
                     priority for preservation reformatting (IASA, 2003).</p>
