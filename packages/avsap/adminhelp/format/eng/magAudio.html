                        Tape Speed:
                     </span>
                     All tapes are recorded at a particular speed, measured in
                     inches per second (ips), and must be played back at that
                     speed for optimum audio quality. Generally, higher-speed
                     recordings have better sound quality. Lower-speed tapes
                     tend to have decreased high-frequency, which increases the
                     amount of noise or tape hiss. More recently developed
                     high-speed cassettes, however, employ noise-reduction
                     technology, such as DBX or Dolby, to reduce tape hiss. The
                     most common playback/record speeds are: 15/16 ips, 1 7/8
                     ips, 3 3/4 ips, 7 1/2 ips, 15 ips, and 30 ips.

                        Tape Track Configuration:
                     </span>
                     In addition to format configurations (tapes that will only
                     play back on the machine they were built for), there are
                     tape track configurations, or layouts. It is often
                     difficult to discern the tape track configuration of
                     non-commercial and/or master tapes unless this information
                     has been documented. Track configuration can also be
                     determined by using a magnetic viewer such as the Arnold
                     B-1022 (https://www.arnoldmagnetics.com/v2/sales/Product.aspx?id=238),
                     which makes the signal recorded on the tape visible. It is
                     essential that the playback head is the same configuration
                     as the track to optimize playback; otherwise recording
                     information is lost or represented incorrectly. Below is a
                     list of the most common tape track configurations as
                     applied most commonly to 1/4" tape:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>
                        Full Track (monaural): Has one track and one channel; is
                        typically found on 1/4" reel-to-reel tape but can
                        pertain to any width tape.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        Half Track (also known as two track monaural): two
                        tracks are recorded in opposite directions, with one
                        channel each; is found on 1/4" reel-to-reel and monaural
                        cassettes.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        Twin Track (also known as "two-track" or "two-track
                        stereo"): Two tracks are found going in the same
                        direction, with each track as a channel; typically found
                        on 1/4" reel-to-reel, but can also be used as a
                        half-track mono.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        Quarter Track (also known as four-track stereo): Four
                        tracks are found in alternating directions: the 1st and
                        3rd tracks comprise "SIDE A" and the 2nd and 4th tracks
                        comprise "SIDE B." Tape stock is 1/4" wide. Note:
                        channel 1 = side A left; channel 2 = side B left;
                        channel 3 = side A right; channel 4 = side B right.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        Four Track (also known as four-track quad): There are
                        four tracks, each going in the same direction and each
                        comprising its own channel. Can be found in 1/4" and
                        1/2" reel-to-reel. These should be left smoothly wound
                        "tails out" (backwards), according to professional
                        applications and environments.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        Stereo cassette (Phillips, aka "standard format" or
                        "compact cassette"): There are four tracks, with the 1st
                        and 2nd tracks as "SIDE A"' and the 3rd and 4th tracks
                        as "SIDE B." Tape stock is 1/8" wide.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        8-track stereo cartridge: There are eight tracks, each
                        in its own channel and going in the same direction,
                        making 4 sides. Tape stock is 1/4" wide. Sixteen track
                        is found on 1" and 2" reel-to-reel. Twenty-four track is
                        found on 2" reel-to-reel (Stauderman, 2003).
                     </li>

                     Continuous loop cartridge (cart) is a magnetic tape-based 
                     recorded sound format. The tape is composed of magnetic
                     particles (or pigment), binder, and a base. Carts are
                     composed of 1/4 inch plastic oxide-coated recording tape
                     wound around a single internal reel and housed in a plastic
                     enclosure. Although carts appear similar to an 8-track,
                     they are distinctly different and are identifiable by a
                     fairly large hole in the lower left backside of the
                     cartridge. Cartridge dimensions are generally 5.25" x 4" x
                     0.93" (NAB A type) but can be found in both smaller and
                     larger sizes (NAB type B and C) depending upon end use and
                     tape length.

                        History
                     </span>
                     Continuous loop cartridges for automatic playback were
                     introduced in the 1950s and were in use primarily in
                     broadcasting until the 1990s. Some major tape manufacturers
                     include Mackenzie Program Repeater, Fidelipac, and Telex
                     "Cart" (Stauderman, 2003).

                     Magnetic tape is susceptible to physical, biological, and
                     chemical risks such as stretching, breaking, drop-outs,
                     mold, and binder deterioration. Additionally, due to binder
                     lubrication and wind issues, carts are subject to binding
                     and tension problems.

                     Continuous loop cartridges are especially susceptible to
                     risks associated with age, hardware, and equipment
                     obsolescence. As carts have been largely replaced by
                     digital technology, the media and related playback
                     equipment are largely obsolete. Since carts are often found
                     in broadcast and other working environments, they most
                     likely have been subject to heavy use. Frequent playback
                     wears down the media and degrades the sound quality over
                     time. This format is especially vulnerable and based on
                     content assessment should be prioritized for reformatting.

                        Issues Related to Playback
                     </span>
                     Each audiovisual medium requires equipment to decode the 
                     information held within it. The oldest carts, the
                     Audiovendor, were playable on an open reel machine.
                     Subsequent cartridges required proprietary playback
                     equipment until 1964, with the implementation of the
                     National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) audio cartridge
                     standard. Although most carts resemble a commercial 8-track
                     cartridge, they cannot be played back on an 8-track
                     machine. Most carts have tape configurations of mono or
                     two-track stereo; both configurations hold a third cueing
                     track. NAB carts have a typical playback speed of 7.5
                     inches per second (ips); however, playback speed can range
                     from 3.75 ips to 15 ips. Due to the single reel design,
                     carts cannot be rewound; however, fast-forward is possible
                     if the playback machine has the functionality to do so.

                     The compact cassette was introduced in by Philips in the 
                     early 1960s. The gained popularity in the mid 1970s and
                     prevailed until the late 1990s when CDs and other digital
                     formats began to supplant it in the marketplace.

                     Magnetic tape is susceptible to physical, biological, and 
                     chemical risks such as stretching, breaking, drop-outs,
                     improper wind, mold, binder deterioration, and unintended
                     recording. Compact cassettes with tape lengths of longer
                     than 90 minutes are especially prone to print-through,
                     stretching, and breaking as the tape is thinner than
                     shorter length tapes. Frequent playback wears on the media
                     and degrades the sound quality over time. This medium is
                     especially susceptible to damage from playback as it may
                     jam in the playback deck and be "eaten," which can cause
                     crimping and breaking during playback. Internal cassette
                     elements such as pads and rollers are susceptible to
                     damage. Cassette housings can be repaired and replaced in
                     the event of damage. Doreen Bolnick and Bruce Johnson's
                     (1989) article "Audiocassette Repair" (Library Journal,
                     114(19), pp. 43-46) is an excellent resource if you are
                     interested in learning about repairing your own compact
                     cassettes.

                     The lifespan of a cassette is dependent upon numerous
                     factors: the quality of the original tape, the type and
                     condition of the machine on which it is played, the amount
                     of care the tapes are given, how often they are played, and
                     how they are packaged. Environmental conditions, especially
                     heat, dust, and humidity, may also affect cassettes
                     (Bolnick &amp; Johnson, 1989). As this format is greatly
                     declining in popularity, media and equipment obsolescence
                     may become a risk; however, at present time both media and
                     equipment are available in the marketplace. Frequent
                     playback wears on the media and, with each playback,
                     degrades the sound quality. The compact cassette medium is
                     not considered an archival format due to its very limited
                     projected lifespan of 10 to 30 years, in addition to its
                     various technological issues. This format is vulnerable
                     and, based on content assessment, should be prioritized for
                     reformatting. Standard analog audio cassettes are not
                     suitable for preservation work under any circumstances
                     (Paton, 1998).

                     All audiovisual media require equipment to decode the 
                     information held within it. Most compact cassettes have a
                     playback speed of 1 7/8 ips; however, some recorders were
                     designed to optionally record and play back at 3 3/4 ips
                     for better fidelity (Stauderman, 2003). The track
                     configuration is often four-track stereo, where tracks 1
                     and 2 compose "Side A" and tracks 3 and 4 compose "Side B."
                     Some home-recording enthusiasts may use a four-track
                     recorder to create multi-track recordings. On these tapes,
                     there are four tracks, all recorded in the same direction.
                     Noise reduction technologies were developed in order to
                     reduce the noise or tape hiss commonly found on thinner
                     tapes recorded at slow speeds. Noise reduction technologies
                     most commonly found on compact cassettes are Dolby (B, C,
                     and S) and dbx (Type II). If a tape has been recorded using
                     noise reduction, the playback equipment must have
                     corresponding noise reduction capabilities in order to
                     accurately play back the tape content. It is often very
                     difficult to determine if a tape has been recorded with
                     noise reduction without having documentation indicating so.

                     The microcassette was introduced to the consumer market in 
                     1969 by Olympus. It offered recording times comparable to
                     standard audio cassettes but in a compact form. It is used
                     primarily for voice recording through microcassette
                     recorders and telephone answering machines. This format
                     may be found in research files and oral history collections.

                     Since the tape is extremely thin, microcassettes are
                     especially prone to breakage and stretching. As with other
                     magnetic media, microcassettes are susceptible to physical
                     , biological, and chemical risks such as stretching,
                     breaking, drop-outs, improper wind, mold, binder
                     deterioration, and unintended recording. Frequent playback
                     wears on the media and, with each playback over time,
                     degrades the sound quality. This medium is especially
                     susceptible to damage from playback as it may jam in the
                     playback deck and be "eaten," which can cause crimping and
                     breaking during playback.

                     The lifespan of a cassette is dependent upon numerous
                     factors: the quality of the original tape, the type and
                     condition of the machine on which it is played, the amount
                     of care the tapes are given, how often they are played, and
                     how they are packaged. The environmental conditions,
                     especially heat, dust, and humidity, may also affect
                     cassettes (Bolnick and Johnson, 1989). Due to the relative
                     fragility of the media, microcassettes have a projected
                     lifespan of 2-10 years (Tadic, 2001). As this format is
                     greatly declining in popularity, media and equipment
                     obsolescence has become a risk; however, at present both
                     media and equipment are available in the marketplace. This
                     format is vulnerable and, based on content assessment,
                     should be prioritized for reformatting.

                     Microcassette recorders often recorded at 15/16 ips;
                     however, most recorders offered the option to record at

                     The Stereo-8 cartridge (or 8-track) is a magnetic 
                     tape-based recorded sound format. The tape is composed of
                     magnetic particles (or pigment), binder, and a polyester
                     base (Stauderman, 2003). Ferric oxide is the most common
                     pigment; other pigments include chromium dioxide, metal
                     particle, and metal evaporated tape (Stauderman, 2003).
                     Cartridge dimensions are generally 5.25" x 4" x 0.8" with a
                     tape width of 1/4".

                     The Stereo-8 cartridge, more commonly known as the 8-track
                     tape or 8-track, was developed by Bill Lear and was a
                     popular format from the mid 1960s through the early 1980s.
                     It evolved from the Muntz 4-track and Fidelipac cartridges.
                     It gained its earliest popularity in the mid 1960s with
                     RCA/Victor releasing commercial music on the format and
                     Ford installing optional 8-track players on some of its
                     automobiles. Eight-tracks were used mostly for commercial
                     releases.

                     As with other magnetic media, 8-tracks are susceptible to
                     physical, biological, and chemical risks such as
                     stretching, breaking, drop-outs, improper wind, mold, and
                     binder deterioration. The format is also especially
                     susceptible to tape binding due to lubrication loss and
                     jamming in the playback machine.

                     Eight-track media and playback equipment are long obsolete.
                     Most recording companies discontinued the release of
                     8-track media by the early 1980s; the manufacture of
                     playback equipment began to decline in the mid to late
                     1970s, as compact cassettes became more popular.

                     Eight-track tapes are recorded at a speed of 3.75 ips. The
                     audio is recorded and played back in two-channel stereo
                     with a tape track configuration of eight tracks, each in
                     its own channel going in the same direction, making 4 sides
                     (Stauderman, 2003). Since the tracks are so thin and close
                     together and because the playback heads move between the
                     pairs of tracks, the heads often become misaligned. When
                     this misalignment occurs, echoes of adjacent tracks may be
                     heard during playback. Specific playback equipment
                     corresponding to the media is required to access the
                     content.

                     Digital Audio Tape (DAT) is a digital magnetic tape-based
                     recorded sound format. The tape is composed of magnetic
                     particles (or pigment), binder, and a base. Bases can be
                     made of paper (c. 1946), polyvinyl chloride or PVC (1946 to
                     mid-1950s) or polyester (mid-50s to present) (Stauderman,
                     2003). Ferric oxide is the most common pigment; others
                     include chromium dioxide, metal particle, and metal
                     evaporated tape (Stauderman, 2003). The dimensions of the
                     shell are 73 mm × 54 mm × 10.5 mm with a tape width of 4mm.

                     Digital Audio Tape, or DAT, was developed by the Sony
                     Corporation and was available by the late 1980s. It was
                     once the preferred method for live compact recording and
                     studio backup; however, the copyright amendment of the
                     Audio Home Recording Act of 1992, which levied a royalty on
                     DAT recorders and media, and the availability and
                     affordability of computer and expansive hard drive space
                     contributed to making DAT obsolete. Playback equipment is
                     no longer in production.

                     The biggest risk to DAT is format and playback equipment
                     obsolescence. The lifespan of the cassette is dependent
                     upon numerous factors: the quality of the original tape,
                     the type and condition of the machine on which it is
                     played, the amount of care the tapes are given, how often
                     they are played, and how they are packaged. The
                     environmental conditions, especially heat, dust, and
                     humidity, may also affect cassettes (Bolnick and Johnson,
                     1989). DAT has known playback problems, typically related
                     to mechanical alignment. DAT is not an archival format.
                     Based on content value, these tapes should be given
                     reformatting priority.

                     Digital Compact Cassette (DCC) is a magnetic tape-based 
                     moving image format. The tape is composed of magnetic
                     particles (chromium dioxide- or cobalt- doped ferric-oxide)
                     (Philips Electronics N.V., 1996), a binder, and a polyester
                     base (Stauderman, 2003). DCC uses PASC (Precision Adaptive
                     Sub-band Coding) compression in order to store the amount
                     of information required for CD-quality sound on an
                     audiotape. The cassette cartridge and tape width is the
                     same as an analog compact cassette (approximately 4" x 2.5"
                     x .5" with a 1/8" tape). The cassettes look similar to
                     analog audio cassettes except they only have access holes
                     for the transport hubs on one side. Also, the tape path is
                     shielded by a metal slider similar to those found on a 3.5
                     inch floppy disc.

                     </span>
                     Digital Compact Cassettes (DCC) were introduced in the
                     early 1990s. It was a format meant to supplant the analog
                     audio tape and compete with MiniDisc and Digital Audio
                     Tapes (DAT). Playback machines were backward-compatible;
                     they supported playback for analog cassettes as well as
                     DCC. It was a popular format in Europe. Philips
                     discontinued manufacturing DCC tapes and playback in
                     equipment in 1996, having lost the "format war" to
                     MiniDisc.

                     The biggest risk to DCC is format and playback equipment 
                     obsolescence. The lifespan of the cassette is dependent
                     upon numerous factors: the quality of the original tape,
                     the type and condition of the machine on which it is
                     played, the amount of care the tapes are given, how often
                     they are played, and how they are packaged. Environmental
                     conditions, especially heat, dust, and humidity, may also
                     affect cassettes (Bolnick &amp; Johnson, 1989).

                     DCC and associated playback equipment are long obsolete.
                     Based on content value, these tapes should be given
                     reformatting priority.

                     Two inch open reel audio is a magnetic tape-based recorded 
                     sound format. The tape is composed of magnetic particles,
                     binder, and a base of either paper, acetate, or polyester
                     (Forgas, 1997). During the 1940s and 1950s, cellulose
                     acetate was the most common tape base (Paton, 1998).
                     Acetate bases can be differentiated from polyester bases
                     by conducting a quick light test. Hold the reel up to a
                     light source&mdash;if light "pipes" through, the base is
                     most likely acetate. Reel size can vary, measuring from 2
                     or 3 inches to 10.5 inches in diameter (14 inch diameters
                     are also possible), with 5, 7, and 10.5 inches being the
                     most common sizes found in archives (Paton, 1998). The tape
                     width is approximately 2".

                     Open reel audiotape was developed in Germany in the late
                     1930s. After WWII, it was further developed in the US by
                     Ampex and EMI, when it began to gain worldwide popularity.
                     Open reel formats with larger tape widths (1/2" and above)
                     and recorded at faster speeds (7 1/2 ips and above) are
                     most commonly found in professional broadcasting and
                     recording environments.

                     Two inch open reel audio is susceptible to risks associated
                     with age, hardware, and equipment obsolescence. Like other
                     types of magnetic media, it is prone to risks such as mold,
                     binder deterioration, physical damage, signal drop-outs,
                     and, in the case of acetate-based tapes, base
                     deterioration.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Tapes should be wound tightly and evenly. An uneven tape
                     pack can allow dirt to come in contact with and abrade the
                     tape's surface and edges. Unevenly wound tapes can cause
                     the tape to warp and lose its shape, which will affect
                     playback sound quality.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Tapes are also prone to blocking or pinning, which occurs 
                     when layers of tape adhere to adjacent layers. Blocking
                     involves large sections of tape adhered together, while
                     pinning involves small sections. Both blocking and pinning
                     can result in loss of information by damaging the tape
                     layers or by preventing playback. Other issues are print
                     through, binder hydrolysis (aka Sticky Shed Syndrome) and,
                     in the case of acetate based tapes, vinegar syndrome.

                     Reel-to-reel audio playback equipment and media are

                     are still filling the needs of professional audio studios.
                     Since magnetic media is a dying medium with a limited
                     lifespan, these tapes should be reformatted (based on the
                     content value).

                     conducting a quick light test. Hold the reel up to a light
                     source&mdash;if light "pipes" through, the base is most
                     likely acetate. Reel size can vary, measuring from 2 or 3
                     inches to 10.5 inches in diameter (14 inch diameters are
                     also possible), with 5, 7, and 10.5 inches being the most
                     common sizes found in archives (Paton, 1998). The tape
                     width is approximately 1". Audio recordings made on 1"
                     tape may be mistaken for videotape.

                     </span>
                     Open reel audiotape was developed in Germany in the late
                     1930s. After WWII, it was further developed in the US by
                     Ampex and EMI, when it began to gain worldwide popularity.
                     Open reel formats with larger tape widths (1/2" and above)
                     and recorded at faster speeds (7 1/2 ips and above) are
                     most commonly found in professional broadcasting and
                     recording environments.

                     </span>
                     One inch open reel audio is susceptible to risks associated
                     with age, hardware, and equipment obsolescence. Like other
                     types of magnetic media, it is prone to risks such as mold,
                     binder deterioration, physical damage, signal drop-outs,
                     and, in the case of acetate-based tapes, base
                     deterioration.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Tapes should be wound tightly and evenly. An uneven tape 
                     pack can allow dirt to come in contact with and abrade the
                     tape's surface and edges. Unevenly wound tapes can cause
                     the tape to warp and lose its shape, which will affect
                     playback sound quality.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Tapes are also prone to blocking or pinning, which occurs
                     when layers of tape adhere to adjacent layers. Blocking
                     involves large sections of tape adhered together, while
                     pinning involves small sections. Both blocking and pinning
                     can result in loss of information by damaging the tape
                     layers or by preventing playback. Other issues are print
                     through, binder hydrolysis (aka Sticky Shed Syndrome) and,
                     in the case of acetate based tapes, vinegar syndrome.

                     and other semi-pro and consumer markets. Prior to digital
                     technology, 1/4" open reel tape was considered the standard
                     audio preservation medium. As analog tape and equipment are
                     obsolete, digital capture has become the archival standard.

                        Prone to the Following Problems
                     </span>
                     Quarter inch open reel audio is susceptible to risks 
                     associated with age, hardware, and equipment obsolescence.
                     Like other types of magnetic media, it is prone to risks
                     such as mold, binder deterioration, physical damage, signal
                     drop-outs, and, in the case of acetate-based tapes, base
                     deterioration. Quarter inch tape may be thinner and more
                     fragile than other kinds of tape, and is more susceptible
                     to stretching and breaking during playback.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                     Tapes should be wound tightly and evenly. An uneven tape
                     pack can allow dirt to come in contact with and abrade the
                     tape's surface and edges. Unevenly wound tapes can cause
                     the tape to warp and lose its shape, which will affect
                     playback sound quality. Tapes with thinner widths are more
                     susceptible to information loss when the tape edge is
                     damaged, as magnetic track configurations are smaller and
                     placed more closely to the tape edge.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                     Tapes are also prone to blocking or pinning, which occurs
                     when layers of tape adhere to adjacent layers. Blocking
                     involves large sections of tape adhered together, while
                     pinning involves small sections. Both blocking and pinning
                     can result in loss of information by damaging the tape
                     layers or by preventing playback.

                     Reel-to-reel audio playback equipment and media are
                     becoming scarce, although there are a few manufacturers who
                     are still filling the needs of professional audio studios.
                     Since magnetic media is a dying medium with a limited
                     lifespan, these tapes should be reformatted (based on the
                     content value).

                     In order to play back a tape properly, you must know the
                     tape track configuration and recording speed. Playback
                     equipment must have a tape transport able to support the
                     full width of the tape, in addition to the proper playback
                     head configuration, to read all the tracks encoded on the
                     tape.

                  Early audiotape may use paper as the carrier layer. This tape
                  can be  very fragile and should be duplicated or digitized

                     Acetate<br/>
                  </strong>
                  Acetate-based tape was fairly common during the early days of
                  magnetic audio recording. These tapes, like acetate motion
                  picture  film, can suffer from acetate decay or
                  &quot;vinegar syndrome.&quot; Unlike  acetate motion picture
                  film, acetate-based magnetic tapes cannot be  frozen without
                  causing damage to the information layer of the tape.  Because
                  of this, acetate decay cannot be halted. This is why in terms
                  of bases, AvSAP considers acetate-based tapes to be of the
                  highest  priority for reformatting and preservation. You can
                  identify acetate tape by holding it in front of a light
                  source.
                  <strong>
                     If appears to &quot;glow&quot; or pipe light, it is most
                     likely acetate.

               <p>
                  Polyester is the most common and stable base for audiotape.
                  In terms  of bases, AvSAP considers polyester to be the lowest
                  priority for  reformatting and preservation. You can identify
                  polyester by placing the tape pack in front of a light source.
                  <strong>
                     If the tape pack appears opaque, that is, you cannot see
                     light through it, it is most likely polyester.
