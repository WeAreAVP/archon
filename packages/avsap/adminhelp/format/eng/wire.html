                  <p><span class="bold">Description: </span>
                     Wire recording is a recorded sound format made of
                     magnetized recording-grade stainless steel wire. The wire
                     is wound around a plastic or metal spool and can be any
                     length.</p>

                  <!-- History Section -->
                  <p><span class="bold"> History </span>
                     Wire recording was the first magnetic media recording
                     technology. It was developed by Vlademar Poulsen in 1898
                     and was in use until the late 1930s/early 1940s when
                     magnetic tape became available. Wire was used in military,
                     commercial, office, and home environments for recording and
                     playback.</p>

                  <!-- Prone to the Following Problems Section -->
                  <p><span class="bold">Prone to the Following Problems</span> <br />
                     One of the most common issues with wire recordings is
                     tangled wire. The wire is extremely thin (approximately
                     .004 inches thick) and can wrap around itself and become
                     tangled and possibly break. This problem is an annoyance
                     but can be relatively easily resolved&mdash;the wire just needs
                     to be untangled and rewound onto the reel. Breaks in the
                     wire can be repaired by knotting the two ends of the wire
                     together. Since wire travels at a high transport speed, the
                     knot will be a minor sonic disturbance during playback.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Although the wire is generally composed of recording-grade
                     stainless steel, some recordings prior to WWII were made on
                     steel wire, which is prone to rust. Occurrences of rust are
                     typically rare. It can weaken the already thin wire and
                     cause the wire to break during handling or playback and can
                     impede signal retrieval.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Signal print through can also be an issue. Print through
                     occurs when the magnetized signal from one section of the
                     wire migrates to lower sections and leaves a sonic imprint.
                     Print through is often identifiable when a faint pre- or
                     post-echo is heard during playback. Storing the wire in a
                     tails-out manner&mdash; with the end of the wire on the
                     outermost layer of the spool&mdash; can aid in minimizing
                     some of the sonic disturbance. Storing the wire tails-out
                     minimizes pre-echo, which is often more annoying than
                     post-echo. However, storing the wire tails-out does not
                     prevent print through from occurring.
                  </p>

                     Wire recording media and equipment are long obsolete, and
                     based on the content, should be considered a high priority
                     for reformatting.</p>

                  <!-- Issues Related to Playback Section -->
                  <p><span class="bold">Issues Related to Playback</span>
                     Wire can tangle and break, especially during playback. It
                     is thin and, depending upon the material, can be
                     susceptible to rust. Any surface abrasion or contaminant
                     can wear down the playback heads on a wire recording.
                     Additionally, playback equipment is increasingly difficult
                     to find. Preservation playback and reformatting may be
                     handled best by a vendor who has experience with handling
                     this format.
