            In order to inspect the tape, you will have to be able to see the
            tape. To this end, you will have to move the tape shield out of the
            way. The tape shield protects the tape from dust and material and
            from being handled. Playback decks move the shield out of the way so
            that the tape can come into contact with the playback heads in the
            machine. You can usually move the shield out of the way yourself in
            order to inspect the tape. Moving the tape shield is usually very
            easy to do. Following are two pictures of a VHS tape, one with the
            shield in place, and the next with the shield moved out of the way
            in order to expose the tape for inspection.

            If your videocassette is in the fully rewound or fast-forwarded
            position&mdash;which is recommended&mdash;you may see tape leader
            when you open the tape shield. Leader is generally made of uncoated
            polyester tape and is used to protect the tape. As tape is played
            back, it is  most likely to be damaged at the beginning and end of
            the film. If there are any issues with the playback equipment, the
            leader would ideally take the brunt of the damage. Damaged leader is
            easier to replace than unique sections of tape.

            Here is the same tape with the shield moved out of the way. Note
            that the small tab on the side of the tape is pushed in. You must
            push this tab in while you move the tape shield up.

            If you load a videocasette with crumpled up or otherwise damaged
            videotape into a deck, you're asking for trouble because you're
            significantly increasing the odds of the tape being eaten and/or
            further damaged by the playback machine. (Sadly, there are no
            guarantees that even a pristine tape won't be eaten by a
            machine&mdash;this is why we must preserve playback equipment
            alongside our media.)

            This is a tape that should
            <strong>
               not
            </strong>
            be played back:
