            Cartridge and Cassette-Based Video - Record Protection
         </h2>
         <p>
            It is very important to copy-protect your cassettes. This is
            probably the single best thing you should do (and the first thing
            you should do) to protect your videocassettes!
         </p>
         <p>
            The record protection tab is your best friend with a videocassette 
            or cartridge! This is a piece of plastic that is either removed or
            slid out into the &quot;save&quot; position in order to protect your
            cassette from accidental erasure or copying over while in its
            playback machine. This should be the first thing you do with your
            videocassettes in order to protect them from accidental information
            loss.
            <strong>
               If you are assessing a tape and notice that the record protection
               tab is not removed or in the &quot;save&quot; position, do it
               now!
            </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
            There are many different ways to copy-protect a videocassette, and
            the method for protecting a cassette depends on which format you're
            dealing with. Following are examples of different formats and how to
            copy protect them. This list is very brief and does not include
            every format&mdash;you may have to do some inspection of the
            cassette in order to figure out how to enable the copy protection
            mechanism on the tape you're holding. The images provided above are
            only some of the copy protection schemes devised for videocassettes
            and cartridges over the years. For a fuller listing of the various
            kinds of cassettes and their copy protection, please see the Texas
            Commission on the Arts' excellent &quot;Videotape Conservation

            The Betacam uses a slightly less intuitive system for protecting t
            he cassette. In this system, there is a little red plastic button
            that, when in the &quot;up&quot; position, allows the tape to be
            recorded over.

            If you take a pen or screwdriver and push the button down, the copy

            You can use the tip of a knife to snap off the tab (make sure you
            dispose of the tab and don't allow it to get inside the cassette).
            Once this tab is gone, you cannot tape over the material recorded on
            the cassette. You can put a piece of tape over the hole should you
            change your mind and decide you want to copy over the tape. For now,
            though, remove the tab and leave the hole open.

            The D2 tape doesn't turn up in archives too often but it gives us a
            chance to see a somewhat different copy protection scheme. It should
            be noted that not only D2 tapes use this scheme. Here a plastic
            screw can be turned from the &quot;Save&quot; to &quot;Rec&quot;
            position. As you can probably guess &quot;Rec&quot; means that the
            tape can be recorded over.

            Using a screwdriver to move this screw to the &quot;Save&quot;
            position will keep this tape safe.

            With mini-DV cassettes (as well as Hi-8/DV-8 tapes, among others)
            the copy protection is a slide found on the tape. It is usually
            labeled. When the slide is in this position, the tape can be copied
            over.

            Using the tip of a knife or screwdriver, move the slide into the
            &quot;save&quot; position. Now you have enabled the copy protection
            and you can't copy over the tape. Note that you are not breaking
            anything off, you're just moving the slide into the save position.

            The copy protection on VHS tapes and Betamax tapes is pretty much 
            the same. Locate the copy protection tab. If it's there, your tape
            can be copied over.

            Take a knife or screwdriver and break the tab off. Again, make sure
            the tab is disposed of. When the tab is gone, your tape is
            protected.

            Umatic tapes have an approximately 1/4&quot; red button located on
            the back, right side of the cartridge. This button can be popped
            out. When the button is removed, copy protection is enabled.
