            Cartridge and Cassette-Based Video - Storage Container
         </h2>
         <p>
            When storing videocassettes and cartridges, it is best to keep them
            in inert plastic containers (Texas, 2007). This helps to keep
            airborne contaminants as well as pests off of the videotapes. There
            are several preservation supply companies that design and sell cases
            for the more ubiquitous cassette formats such as VHS and mini-DV.
            The container for a videotape should be clean and should provide
            some protection for the recording surface. Moldy, damaged and dirty
            containers should be replaced with clean ones.
         </p>
         <p>
            <strong>
               If your videocassette is housed in a plastic container and you're
               unsure if it is inert or is acceptable for preservation purposes,
               check the condition of the container. If it is protecting the
               tape from dust, pests and other contaminants, not shedding or
               introducing any contaminants through its own degradation, and is
               clean and free of mold or excessive dirt, the container is
               acceptable for use.
            </strong>
            Rehousing to a more expensive inert plastic container is not vital
            in this case. If the tape is housed in anything other than a hard
            plastic container, e.g. in a cardboard slipcover, or is not
            sufficiently protected, it should be rehoused in an inert plastic
            container.
