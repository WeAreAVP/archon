            Orientation in Storage
         </h2>
         <p>
            While in storage, the orientation of a cassette can affect its
            long-term well-being.
            <strong>
               The best orientation for cassettes is vertical and
               &quot;on edge&quot;
            </strong>
            (Library of Congress, 2006).

            Videocassettes and cartridges, generally speaking, like to be stored
            upright on shelves like books. Piling videotapes one upon the other
            tends to stress the cassettes at the bottom of the stack. This can,
            over time, cause the plastic housing of the cartridges to warp and
            even crack, leading to poor playback. Tapes that have been stacked
            one upon the other for long periods should be closely inspected for
            cracks and fractures before playback. Storing tapes in their case
            and upright also helps to protect the cassette within from water
            damage (water can flow off the case without pooling inside it) as
            well as from dust and dirt.
