            MOLD CAN BE TOXIC. Proceed with caution when examining tapes for
            mold. Do not handle moldy tapes longer than necessary. If you find a
            moldy tape place it in a sealable plastic bag until conservation
            action can be taken. To check for mold on a videocassette:
         </p>
         <ul class="strong clear">
            <li>
               Inspect the tape container. If you see fuzzy brown, black, white,
               green or mustard patches this is most likely mold. Mold on the
               container is a good indicator that the mold has traveled to or
               from the cassette. If you suspect mold, immediately seal the tape
               into a plastic bag.
            </li>
            <li>
               Look through the clear plastic windows on the cassette, or any
               other area which allows you to see the tape pack. Look for black,
               brown, white, green or mustard colored fuzzy patches. If you see
               any, you're most likely looking at mold.
            </li>
            <li>
               Carefully flip open the tape shield. How the tape shield opens
               differs between videocassettes; however, you are generally
               looking for a button or tab on the short edge of the cassette
               generally near the tape shield. See:
               <a href="http://www.arts.state.tx.us/video/assess.asp">
                  http://www.arts.state.tx.us/video/assess.asp</a>
               for additional tape handling, and inspection guidance including
               how to open a tape shield. Again, look for for black, brown,
               white, green or mustard colored fuzzy patches or fibers at the
               edge of the tape. It can be very hard to assess mold on
               videocassettes, largely because you can't see very well into the
               cassette at the tape itself.

            Tapes suspected of being moldy should NOT be played back as the mold
            can get into the playback machinery and cause poor playback. Mold
            can also travel onto other tapes so it is best to quarantine any
            tapes suspected of being moldy. It should also be noted that
            exposure to mold is very bad for humans, so your moldy tapes (and
            tapes suspected of being moldy) should be put inside sealed plastic
            bags (Texas, 2007). Mold is very difficult to clean off of video and
            audiotapes, particularly cassette-based tapes, so you're going to
            have to send these tapes on to professionals for thorough cleaning.
            This isn't something you're going to want to do in-house (Wheeler,
            2002, p. 12).

            Following are some images of audiotapes exhibiting mold. Note the
            patches of white material on the tape pack. This is the mold.
