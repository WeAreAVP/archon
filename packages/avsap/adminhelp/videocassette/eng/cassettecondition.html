            Cassette Inspection At-A-Glance:
         </p>
         <ul class="strong clear">
            <li>
               look for cracks, stress fractures
            </li>
            <li>
               look for dust, dirt, mold or other contaminant which can affect the tape
            </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
            You're looking for cracks, stress fractures, dust, and so on.
            Likewise, a dirty, dusty or moldy tape can transmit filth into the
            playback machine, which would impair the machine's ability to play
            back the best possible image and sound. Remember, one of your jobs
            with regard to audiovisual preservation is to try to ensure the best
            possible image and/or sound quality during playback!
