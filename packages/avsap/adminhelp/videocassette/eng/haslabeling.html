            Labeling
         </h2>
         <p class="strong">
            If your item has any kind of labeling on the container, the item
            itself or any related material, we highly recommend that you return
            to the General tab under Assessments Manager, and enter this
            information in the notes field.

            Unidentified tapes have a tendency to get overlooked or shuffled to
            the back of the shelf in an institution. Basic information should be
            recorded on a label both on the tape itself and on the tape's
            container. Information like title, creator, some kind of
            alphanumeric identifier (whatever your institution uses, be it
            accession number, catalog number, and so on), and some kind of date
            information (whatever your institution uses here&mdash;the date the
            tape was received, the date the tape was recorded, et cetera). Bear
            in mind that describing your materials, both on the containers and
            in a catalog, help to keep the materials accessible. When you can't
            find something, you're less likely to devote time, effort, and funds
            to its preservation.
