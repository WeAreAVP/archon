            Instantaneous Disk - Inner Core
         </h2>
         <p>
            Instantaneous discs can be made of aluminum or cellulose nitrate on
            a core. The core can be a number of varying materials, including
            glass, aluminum, and cardboard&mdash; all of which are subject to
            damage. Humid and inconsistent storage conditions can cause porous
            cores to swell and shrink, causing the grooved surface material to
            crack and separate from the core. You can typically identify the
            disc's core (if there is one) by looking through the center spindle
            hole(s). If a shiny, metallic glint is visible, you have an aluminum
            core disc. If you see a brownish, fibrous material, you have a
            cardboard or paper core disc. You may not be able to easily
            determine if a disc has a glass core simply by looking through the
            spindle holes. To verify, you can carefully shine a light source,
            such as a flashlight, through the disc. If the disc appears
            transparent and light pipes through, then you most likely have a
            glass core disc. When inspecting the discs, look for visible damage.
            If you have a glass core disc, be sure to look for cracks and
            breaks. Worn and damaged aluminum core discs may have bends or
            dents.
