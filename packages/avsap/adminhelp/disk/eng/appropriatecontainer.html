            Appropriate containers At-A-Glance:
         </p>
         <ul class="strong clear">
            <li>
               Ideally, these discs should be housed in high density
               polyethylene sleeves
            </li>
            <li>
               These sleeves may be thin enough to fit into the original paper
               sleeve
            </li>
            <li>
               Some plastic or plastic-lined sleeves should not be used.
            </li>
            <li>
               &quot;Bad&quot; sleeves are clear and have a sticky or tacky
               feel; &quot;good&quot; sleeves are frosted in appearance and have
               a slippery feel
            </li>
            <li>
               If the original container is a binder, the discs should be
               removed and housed in individual sleeves, as the binder is most
               likely made of acidic paper.
            </li>

         <p>
            Containers protect the surface of the recording from dirt, dust,
            mold and vermin. These contaminants can damage the surface of the
            recording, which can affect its sound quality and even render the
            recording unplayable.
            <strong>
               Ideally, these discs should be housed in high density
               polyethylene sleeves,
            </strong>
            which may be thin enough to fit into the original paper sleeve (in
            case the original sleeve contains important labeling or historic
            information that you would want to keep). However, some plastic or
            plastic-lined sleeves should not be used.
            <strong>
               As a rule of thumb, &quot;bad&quot; sleeves are clear and have a
               sticky or tacky feel; &quot;good&quot; sleeves are frosted in
               appearance and have a slippery feel
            </strong>
            (Library of  Congress, 2002).
            <strong>
               If the original container is a binder, the discs should be
               removed and housed in individual sleeves, as the binder is most
               likely made of acidic paper.
            </strong>
            Additionally, recordings can get caught in the edge of a failing
            binder and can be damaged. Remove any shrink wrap that is still on
            the outer sleeve, since it can continue to shrink and harm the
            original outer sleeve or the recording itself.
         </p>

            The container can speak volumes on the storage history of your
            recording. Is it moldy? Does it appear to have water damage? Is it
            falling apart? A container should protect the recording without
            damaging or leaving contaminants on the surface. Original paper
            sleeves may deteriorate and leave fibers, which can abrade the
            delicate recording surface. Since disc grooved media is especially
            susceptible to damage from dirt and contaminants, it is especially
            important that these recordings are housed in appropriate materials.
