            Labeling
         </h2>
         <p class="strong">
            If your item has any kind of labeling on the container, the item
            itself, or any related material we highly recommend that you return
            to the General tab under Assessments Manager and enter this
            information in the notes field.
         </p>

            Unidentified recordings have a tendency to get overlooked or
            shuffled to the back of the shelf. Basic information should be
            recorded on a label on the recording's container. The discs
            themselves are usually not marked, to avoid damage (Warren, 1994).
            Information like title, creator, alphanumeric identifier (whatever
            your institution uses&mdash;accession number, catalog number, and
            so on), and date information (whatever your institution
            uses&mdash;the date the tape was received, the date the tape was
            recorded, etc.). Bear in mind that describing your materials, both
            on the containers and in a catalog, helps to keep the materials
            accessible. When you cannot find something, you are less likely to
            devote time, effort and funds to preserve it.
         </p>
         <p>
            Additionally, if you are considering rehousing your disc, you should
            transfer or retain the labeling and notes (if extant) on the
            original container. These notes may be helpful to a future
            researcher. A label can provide important information about the
            recording such as date, title, author or artist, and recording
            speed. Handwritten labels often found on instantaneous discs may be
            especially important as the disc is most likely a unique object
            (that is, it has not been commercially reproduced and may be the
            only known copy containing the information on the disc). Labels are
            paper-based, affixed with glue or heat-set, and contain dyes and
            inks. Each of these attributes makes the label
            vulnerable&mdash;paper can degrade, glue can dissolve, and inks and
            dyes may fade. Taking extra care while cleaning and handling the
            discs can help to preserve the labels (Gibson, 1987).
