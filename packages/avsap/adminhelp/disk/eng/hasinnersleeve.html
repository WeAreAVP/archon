         </h2>
         <p>
            Archival recordings might be found housed with a paper inner sleeve.
            These paper sleeves are problematic as they are usually acidic and
            can degrade onto the recording surface, leaving behind &quot;paper
            flour&quot;  deposits of dust, fibers and flakes (Warren, 1994).
            <strong>
               Ideally, discs should be housed in a high density polyethylene
               sleeve.
            </strong>
            Some sleeves may be thin enough to fit into the original paper
            sleeve, should the original sleeve contain important labeling or
            historic information that you would want to keep (Library of
            Congress, 2002). However, some plastic or plastic-lined sleeves
            should not be used. As a rule of thumb, &quot;bad&quot; sleeves are
            clear and have a sticky or tacky feel; &quot;good&quot; sleeves are
            frosted in appearance and have a slippery feel (Library of
            Congress).
