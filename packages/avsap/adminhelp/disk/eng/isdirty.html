            Disk - Dust and Dirt
         </h2>
         <p>
            Dirt and dust on the surface of a record can be especially damaging.
            A dirty record played back without prior cleaning can cause the
            turntable stylus to collect the debris and drag it through the
            grooves. This can cause irreparable damage to the recording and
            adversely affect playback sound quality. Thus, all recordings should
            be cleaned before playing them back (Gibson, 1987).
