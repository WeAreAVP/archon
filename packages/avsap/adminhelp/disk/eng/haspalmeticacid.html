            Instantaneous Disk - Palmetic Acid
         </h2>
         <p>
            As the cellulose-based coating deteriorates,
            <strong>
               a whitish, oily deposit develops on the surface of the recording.
            </strong>
            This deposit is the result of the plasticizer exuding to the
            surface. Plasticizer loss can lead to additional noise during
            playback and is an indicator that the laminate is shifting and,
            most likely, shrinking. Evidence of palmitic acid typically occurs
            on discs that have been stored in humid conditions and can sometimes
            be mistaken for mold.
            <strong>
               Mold will have a dull, lattice-like appearance compared to the
               oily appearance of palmitic acid.
