            High humidity and temperature in your storage area can foster the
            growth of mold on your discs and associated containers. Mold can
            affect the sound quality of a recording and can damage the delicate
            recording surface. Mold typically has a dull, lattice-like
            appearance.

            When assessing instantaneous discs and examining surface
            contaminants, it may be difficult to tell if you are looking at mold
            or plasticizer breakdown. Plasticizer exudation can be identified by
            the appearance of a fatty or greasy-looking white powder, whereas
            mold may have a more flat and dull appearance.
