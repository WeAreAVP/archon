            Tape Breakdown At-A-Glance:
         </p>
         <ul class="strong clear">
            <li>
               Tapes that have been stored in hot and/or humid conditions are
               at significantly higher risk of breakdown scenarios like
               sticky shed syndrome or binder adhesion failure
            </li>
            <li>
               Determining tape breakdown can be very difficult without playing
               a tape back
            </li>
            <li>
               Tapes that create a squealing sound during playback likely have a
               problem with sticky shed or other type of tape breakdown
            </li>
            <li>
               Playback devices should be inspected for residue left by playing
               back tapes. This residue is often the only clue that your tapes
               have a problem with tape breakdown
            </li>
            <li>
               Certain brands/formulations of magnetic tape may be at greater
               risk of sticky shed syndrome. Contact a magnetic tape
               transfer/preservation specialist for more information on which
               brands or formulations of tape are at higher risk.
            </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
            Magnetic tape is made of at least three layers. The first is the
            plastic tape layer, which is the base upon which the other layers
            are  supported. The topmost layer is the recording layer, which
            contains the metal particles that carry information&mdash;this is
            the layer that is  recorded upon. Between these two layers is a
            binder layer, which keeps the recording layer adhered to the base
            layer. Sticky shed syndrome, also known as binder hydrolysis, is a
            situation in which the binder layer has taken on moisture from the
            environment and starts to break down. Sticky shed is very common and
            can be difficult to diagnose by eye. It can be present as a whitish
            powder on the tape, but it can also be invisible. During playback,
            sticky shed can cause the tape to squeal and can distort the audio
            and/or video. Playing back a tape suffering from sticky shed
            syndrome can cause the binder material to flake off and gum up the
            heads and other parts of your playback deck.

            Almost all magnetic tape can suffer from sticky shed syndrome. This
            is an example of inherent vice, a situation in which the very design
            of an information recording medium carries within it the seeds of
            its own demise. Some brands of audio or videotape are more
            susceptible to sticky shed than others; however, we must do our best
            to control and monitor the storage environment for all of our
            magnetic media to slow down incidences of sticky shed syndrome.
            Controlling humidity levels is essential for preventing the
            syndrome. Variances in humidity and temperature should always be
            avoided, as these variances can also prematurely age materials.
            Generally speaking, it is best to move audiovisual materials from
            the attic, shed, basement or other environment that does not
            maintain constant temperature and relative humidity throughout the
            year. According to the Library of Congress (2002), magnetic tapes
            should be stored at 45 to 50 degrees F and 20 to 30% relative
            humidity (RH). Storing tape at below 45% RH is not advisable as it
            can break down the lubrication that is built into the tape.
            While film likes to be frozen for long-term storage, magnetic tape
            does not. Many experts agree that controlling the humidity in which
            magnetic tapes are stored is more important than controlling the
            temperature (Clark, 2002, p. 225).

            Remember that magnetic tapes that squeal during playback, show
            powdery or flaky material on the tape or have been stored in very
            humid conditions could be suffering from sticky shed syndrome and
            should not be played back. Such tapes can in some cases be
            temporarily treated by being baked at low levels (like dehydrating
            food). When a tape is baked successfully it can usually be played
            back one time, which is usually enough to transfer the information
            off of the bad tape and onto a new medium. While baking can be very
            effective, we do not recommend you try to do this yourself. Instead,
            contact a professional audiovisual restoration facility.

            It should be noted that there are other tape failure scenarios and,
            like sticky shed, they may not be able to be identified from a
            visual inspection. The lubricants that tapes are impregnated with
            can fail, the layer that adheres the base to the magnetic recording
            layer can fail and a whole host of other problems can beset tapes.
            It should be safe to say that older tapes and tapes that have been
            stored poorly, are exhibiting any kind of flaking off of tape material
            and/or are depositing material on the playback equipment should be
            considered to be at high risk of information loss. Even magnetic
            tapes which exhibit no problems could still be at risk of developing
            them in the future. For this reason it is critical that a repository
            that wants to ensure access to its magnetic materials has plans to
            reformat or digitize these items.
