         <h2>First Generation/Master/Original Items</h2>
         <p>
            When we talk about "generations" in audiovisual preservation, we're talking about "copies."
            If something is a second-generation item, it means that it has been copied from the original, or "master."
            (We should note that sometimes people use the term "master copy," which can be confusing. A master copy is a master.)
         </p>
         <p>
            The original audiovisual item is the most valuable iteration of the item that you can have,
            because it should have the best audio and video quality possible when compared to its copies.
            (This assumes, of course, that the original has been well preserved and is in good shape.)
            Another reason for giving priority to the original is that it may be the only iteration there is of the item.
            This means that any damage that occurs to the original could mean that information is lost forever.
            Even if you have a copy, damage to the master means that you must resort to using copies
            that may have inferior picture and/or sound.
         </p>
         <p>
            Following best practice, you should use the master as little as possible and store it in the best conditions possible.
            Many institutions use their master once to make a "secondary master." This secondary master is then used to make copies for access.
            Ideally you should almost never have to return to the master; it can stay in the best possible storage conditions in perpetuity.
            If the item you are assessing is a master, then it will be higher in priority for reformatting and preservation than those items which are copies.

            In the case of film, your collection may contain many copies or iterations of the same film.
            These various film elements could be original negatives or positives used to create the master print.
            For example, 16mm film which has been acquired from a film maker could be labeled as A and B rolls.
            These elements are original positive or negative images used to create the final master print.
            Additionally, there may be a sound track element on a separate roll of film.
            This combination of A, B and soundtrack rolls comprise the whole of the final film print.
            It is important to keep these elements together (at least, intellectually) as they are original materials
            and may be used in the future to reprint the entire film.
         </p>
         <p>
            It is especially important to note if a film is reversal.
            Reversal film is the original film that runs through the camera and is then processed into a final projection print.
            Thus, the camera original and projected film are the same.
            If this film has not been duplicated, you are running the risk of losing what may be the only copy if this film is damaged (NFPF, 2004).
