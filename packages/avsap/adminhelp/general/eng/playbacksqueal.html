         <h2>Squealing During Playback</h2>
         <p>
            Squealing during playback can be a result of a number of things.
            This could denote problems with the playback machine, especially if
            many cassettes inserted into the machine exhibit the same problem.
            It could also be a problem with the tape itself. One common cause of
            squealing is sticky shed syndrome. Tapes that squeal or make any
            other abnormal noise during playback should be removed immediately
            from the playback machine. It is not recommended that you play these
            tapes back yourself; you should send them to a professional
            restoration expert to be reformatted. If you determine that the
            playback machine is the problem, the machine should be serviced
            before you use it again.
