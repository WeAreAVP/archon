         <p>
            It is often difficult to truly assess an item's condition without
            playing it back. It is entirely possible to have an item that, to
            the eye, appears to be in good condition, but when played has very
            bad sound quality. The only way to truly assess an item's quality is
            to play it back. Playback, however, carries with it the risk that
            your item could be irrevocably damaged and/or could cause damage to
            the playback machine. For this reason we do not recommend playback
            as a means of assessment. However, if you do play an item and find
            that the sound quality is poor, it likely means the item is in need
            of reformatting. If this item has been played back recently, there
            may be notes indicating the playback quality.
