            Pest Damage
         </h2>
         <p>
            Pests like insects and rodents tend to like paper and textile
            materials more than audiovisual materials. That said, pests can
            still do damage to your AV collections. Insects can be attracted to
            the organic components of film emulsion. Film cans, both plastic and
            metal, tend to keep most pests out. When assessing the exposure of
            your collections to pests, it is necessary to look not just at the
            materials themselves and their containers&mdash;it is also important
            to look around at the rest of the environment. Insects and rodents
            tend to leave droppings in areas they inhabit. Insects tend to leave
            behind a substance called frass, which is the undigested fibers from
            paper. If you see droppings and/or frass in your storage area is a
            strong sign that your materials are being exposed to pests. Small,
            irregular holes on paper-based containers (such as sleeves for
            grooved-disc audio recordings) are also a sign that pests have
            attacked your materials.

            Some tips for reducing your materials' exposure to pests are to
            refrain from eating anywhere near your collections materials. Crumbs
            and food waste draw rodents and insects, so eat far from your
            collections. Another tip is to be careful opening donated materials
            when you receive them. Pests can hitch rides into your facility on
            these materials, so having a good, clean staging area where you can
            inspect donated items for, among other things, pest-related evidence
            can help you reduce your storage environments' exposure to pests
