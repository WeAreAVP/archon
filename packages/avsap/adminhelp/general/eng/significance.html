         <h2>Item Significance</h2>
         <p>
            AvSAP recognizes that an item's informational content can and often
            should be taken into account when generating a prioritized
            preservation plan. If you have an item that is in poor physical
            condition but has little significance to your institution, you may
            choose to put it lower on your prioritized list than an item in
            better physical condition that has greater significance to your
            institution. For this reason, AvSAP can factor this significance
            dimension in its results. You may also choose to exclude this
            consideration; this is useful if you only have interest in the
            physical condition of the items you are assessing, without respect
            to the informational content of the materials. Choosing a level of
            significance in this question will not affect the overall score of
            the item. It can, however, allow you to rank your decision list by
            significance should you choose to. Consider this question as a way
            to "flag" significant materials in your decision list. This field is
            optional but we recommend you consider the significance of the item
            as it will affect your preservation decisions, particularly when you
            have a limited amount of funds and a great deal of materials to
            treat.

            For our purposes, we break down the concept of "significance"
            according to traditional archival theory (Hunter, 2003, p. 53):
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>
               the significance of the item to your institution and its mission
            </li>
            <li>
               the significance of the item to your users
            </li>
            <li>
               the contribution of the item to scholarship
            </li>
            <li>
               the uniqueness of the item. (Uniqueness refers to how many copies
               of this item exist. Commercially produced materials are not
               usually considered unique. An example of an item that is unique
               would be an 8mm home movie. It is unlikely that there are many
               copies of this movie.)
            </li>
            <li>
               the costs of retention, or how much it would cost you (in terms
               of space, funds, and time) to maintain, store, and provide access
               to the item
            </li>
            <li>
               the importance of the events, people, or subjects dealt with in
               the moving image or sound recording
            </li>
            <li>
               the political considerations involved in retaining the item. In
               other words, the importance to you or your community of the donor
               or creator of the item
            </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
            These are just some of the factors you can consider when making
            decisions about the significance of an item. Some institutions may
            consider the fiscal value of an item as well, which is usually
            determined by an outside (third party) appraiser. Assigning a high
            level of significance to most or all of your materials will render
            this field worthless in your final decision list. For this reason
            we strongly recommend you to be as discerning as possible when
            assigning a level of significance to your materials.
