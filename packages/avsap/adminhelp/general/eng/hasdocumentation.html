         <p>
            A strictly visual inspection of an item will not provide all the
            clues about the item's sound quality. If you have any past
            documentation about playback or cylinder quality, this information
            can be extremely useful in assessing the cylinder without having to
            subject it to playback risks. Additionally, documentation may
            provide evidence of past preservation measures taken on the content
            or item. You should always document any preservation measures that
            you take on your materials. This provides evidence to future
            preservationists and researchers about the path that the
            content/object has traveled.
         </p>
         <p>
            Your documentation should NOT be stored with the item. You should
            store your documentation (for example, notes written on paper) in a
            separate physical location. Paper has numerous conservation issues
            and can be more damaging than helpful. For example, paper can damage
            your cylinder by shedding fibers that can abrade the cylinder's
            surface. If you track your items via electronic means, you may be
            able to note preservation history in your electronic tracking
            system.
         </p>
         <p>
            Having additional documentation about your item can help inform your
            future preservation decisions.
