         <h2>Playback Equipment</h2>
         <p>
            One of the great challenges of audiovisual preservation is the fact that AV materials
            require playback machines in order to "decode" the information stored on the materials.
            This applies to all audiovisual formats. A further complication is that the playback
            machine must be appropriate to the format of the AV material.
            When we consider how many different AV formats there are (hundreds), we see that this is a large challenge indeed.
            The playback machine must also be well-maintained, as it can damage
            the materials fed into it if the machine is in poor repair.
         </p>
         <p>
            It is important to look at your collection and consider what formats are most valuable to your institution,
            what formats are accessed the most by your users, and what format you have the most of.
            These will be the materials that you should have playback equipment for, if at all possible.
            This can be challenging, but there are avenues you can explore.
            Local television and radio stations, colleges and universities
            (particularly those with film, art, communications or journalism departments)
            and audio recording studios often have older equipment that they no longer need.
            These are excellent places to establish relationships with as you
            may be able to procure equipment at very reasonable prices.
            Keep in mind that universities and colleges often have considerable
            red tape when selling or donating their equipment, so be prepared
            to invest some time and effort when working with them.
         </p>

            Remember: never put any collections materials into a playback
            machine without first testing that machine.
            Have a "dummy" item that you can test a piece of equipment with.
            For example, you can designate a VHS tape as your dummy tape and
            use it to test your recently procured and/or serviced VCR.
            Ideally this should neither be an item that is a part of your
            collection nor has any value so that it will make no difference
            if you damage the item.
         </p>
         <p>
            We do not recommend that you service a piece of playback equipment
            yourself because of the potential for damage to both the equipment
            and AV materials. We recommend that you find and establish a
            relationship with a local repair service. Maintaining your playback
            equipment should be at least as important as maintaining your
            collections.
         </p>
         <p>
            If you do not have (and cannot acquire) playback equipment, it does
            not mean that the AV materials are without value; it may be an
            indicator of higher preservation priority if the playback equipment
            is obsolete or unavailable to you at your archives. These materials
            can be especially vulnerable. Film duplication vendors will most
            likely have the equipment and would be able to transfer the film to
            a format accessible to your archives.
         </p>
         <p>
            Remember, if you have materials with no way to play them back,
            these items will have diminished accessibility and can end up
            costing you time, effort and money when you have to send them out
            to be transferred to a format your institution does have playback
            equipment for. If you plan to digitize your materials, you will
            have to have well-functioning playback equipment for each format
            you decide to digitize.
