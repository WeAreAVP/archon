         <h2>Playback</h2>
         <p>
            Playback and handling are the leading causes of damage to audiovisual items. 
            A film, for example, is most likely to be damaged being fed into or coming off of a projector.
            Any playback machine, no matter how well maintained, can cause damage to an audiovisual item.
            That said, it is still best to maintain your playback equipment alongside your audiovisual items.
            Regular service and cleaning is critical to helping minimize the risks of playback for your materials.
            Sometimes an item may only have one play left before it is permanently damaged, rendering it unusable.
            If an item must be played back, an operator skilled in handling the playback equipment and at identifying
            problems with the media prior to playback should be the only person allowed to play the material in question.
            Allowing media to be handled and played back by untrained staff or patrons is a danger to the material.
