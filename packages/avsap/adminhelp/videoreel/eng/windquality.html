            Open Reel Video - Tape Pack
         </h2>
         <p>
            All video and audiotapes should exhibit a tight, even tape pack.
            This means that when you look at the tape itself from a slight angle
            (usually through the clear or translucent window in the cassette),
            you notice no strands of tape that are standing higher than the
            rest. These strands of tape are referred to as &quot;popped strands.
            &quot; A tape will show popped strands if the tape is damaged or
            warped, the tape has been stored without being completely rewound or
            fast-forwarded, or if the playback deck plays, rewinds or
            fast-forwards in a less-than-uniform speed. Caution should be
            exercised when playing back a tape without a uniform tape back, as
            it could indicate a problem that will be exacerbated by playing it
            back&mdash;sometimes with disastrous results. Checking the tape pack
            should be a step taken before playing back any tape.

            This open-reel audiocassette is exhibiting popped strands.<br/>
            Videocassettes and open-reel video materials can have popped strands
            that look very similar.

            Many institutions, including the Library of Congress, recommend
            storing all tapes (audio or video) in the fully fast-forwarded
            position. This can prevent tape pack issues while the tape is in
            storage and will also force you to fully rewind a tape before
            playing it back (called &quot;exercising&quot; the tape), which can
            help keep a tape in good shape. Some institutions also create a
            schedule whereby all tapes  that are in good enough condition are
            taken from the shelf and fully rewound and then fast-forwarded.
            Making it a point to periodically exercise tapes that are not
            exhibiting problems can help keep those tapes in good condition.
         </p>
         <p>
            Both ends of open reel tapes should be secured with a very
            light-stick, acid-free, removable tape (Texas Commission on the
            Arts, 2007). This will prevent the end of the open reel tape from
            becoming damaged or the tape pack from loosening while in storage.
            If the reel's wind is already loose, gently re-wind the tape back
            onto the reel.
