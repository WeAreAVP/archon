            Open Reel Video - Orientation in Storage
         </h2>
         <p>
            Videotapes, generally speaking, like to be stored upright on shelves
            like books. Piling videotapes one upon the other tends to stress the
            cassettes at the bottom of the stack. This can, over time, cause the
            plastic housing of the cartridges to warp and even crack, leading to
            poor playback. Tapes that have been stacked one upon the other for
            long periods should be closely inspected for cracks and fractures
            before playback. Storing tapes in their case and upright also helps
            to protect the cassette within from water damage (water can flow off
            the case without pooling inside it) as well as from dust and dirt.
