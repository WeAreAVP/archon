         <p>
            It can be very hard to assess mold on videotape, largely due to the
            fact that you can't see very well into the reel at the tape itself.
            You may be able to see contamination through the windows on the
            reel. If you see a white or brown patches or strands on the tape,
            the chances are that you're dealing with mold. Inspecting the
            container the tape was stored in is a good idea also&mdash;if you
            see mold on this container, then it's a good bet the mold has
            traveled onto the tape. Tapes suspected of being moldy should NOT
            be played back as the mold can get into the playback machinery and
            cause poor playback. Mold can also travel onto other tapes so it is
            best to quarantine any tapes suspected of being moldy. It should
            also be noted that exposure to mold is very bad for humans, so your
            moldy tapes (and tapes suspected of being moldy) should be put
            inside sealed plastic bags (Texas, 2007). Mold is very difficult to
            clean off of video and audiotapes, particularly cassette-based
            tapes, so you're going to have to send these tapes on to
            professionals for thorough cleaning. This isn't something you're
            going to want to do in-house (Wheeler, 2002, p. 12).

            Following are some images of audiotapes exhibiting mold. Note the
            patches of white material on the tape pack. This is the mold.
