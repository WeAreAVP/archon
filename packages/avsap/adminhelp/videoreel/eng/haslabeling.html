            Labeling
         </h2>
         <p class="strong">
            If your item has any kind of labeling on the container, the item
            itself or any related material, we highly recommend that you return
            to the General tab under Assessments Manager and enter this
            information in the notes field.
         </p>
         <p>
            Unidentified reels have a tendency to get overlooked or shuffled to
            the back of the shelf. Basic information should be recorded on a
            label both on the reel itself and on the reel's container.
            Information like title, creator, alphanumeric identifier (whatever
            your institution uses&mdash;accession number, catalog number, and so
            on), and date information (whatever your institution uses&mdash;the
            date the tape was  received, the date the tape was recorded, etc.).
            Bear in mind that describing your materials, both on the containers
            and in a catalog, helps to keep the materials accessible. When you
            cannot find something, you are less likely to devote time, effort,
            and funds to its preservation. If you are discarding an old
            container which holds labeling information, transfer the information
            to the new container.
