            Open Reel Video - Storage Container
         </h2>
         <p>
            When storing videocassettes and cartridges, it is best to keep them
            in inert plastic containers (Texas Commission on the Arts, 2007).
            This helps to keep airborne contaminants as well as pests off of the
            videotapes. There are several preservation supply companies that
            design and sell cases for the more ubiquitous cassette formats such
            as VHS and mini-DV.

            When inspecting older 1&quot; and 2&quot; open reel tape containers,
            be sure to check the inside of the container for debris. Some
            2&quot; quad shipping containers have a spongy lining that
            deteriorates over time into a powdery and then gummy substance that
            is very difficult to clean. This can cause damage to the surface of
            the tape. If you encounter this situation, place the tape (after a
            thorough inspection) into a clean, debris-free container. Two inch
            quad tape containers are easily identifiable; they are 15&quot; X
            15&quot; X 4&quot; square containers and can weigh 20-30 lbs (Texas
            Commission on the Arts, 2007).
