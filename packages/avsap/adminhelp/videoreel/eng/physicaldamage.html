            Physical Damage
         </h2>
         <p>
            If you load a videocasette with crumpled up or otherwise damaged
            videotape into a deck, you're asking for trouble because you're
            significantly increasing the odds of the tape being eaten and/or
            further damaged by the playback machine. (Sadly, there are no
            guarantees that even a pristine tape won't be eaten by a
            machine&mdash;this is why we must preserve playback equipment
            alongside our media.) Open reel tapes are generally easier to
            inspect than cartridge based videotapes. Look for crumpled tape or
            popped strands in the tape pack. Tape damage is not limited to the
            edges of the tape, so look out for wrinkles or damage along the
            width of the tape.
